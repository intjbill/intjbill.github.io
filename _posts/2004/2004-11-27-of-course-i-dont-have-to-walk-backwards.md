After some thought, I revealed a curiosity that is rather enlightening— even a little crazy. It involves opportunity costs and the like— all that "useless" jargon that I picked up in business school. The planning is somewhat generalized since it only takes in consideration this one facet of my life.

I assessed that if I lived back at my old apartment at Georgian Woods and worked at U of M, I could walk BACKWARDS and get to work faster than taking a car. How can I say this? It takes a longer time for me to earn the net income and arguably gross, to support the service of an automobile per day than it takes for me to walk the 3 miles distance— backwards! We are not even talking about a bike here.

Of course as one might expect, I would have to stick around at work and earn the additional money that in the past would be funneled toward supporting the transportation service. With the freed up $7700/yr, I could put half of it toward international travel for 3-4 weeks, either back to Europe or indulge the craving I have for a quiet, tropical island on the Pacific.

What I find so bizarre is how something as ordinary, REALLY ordinary especially when one checks out all the cars over at the mall, can instead be used for something extraordinary! The question comes to me as to why we settle for so little.
