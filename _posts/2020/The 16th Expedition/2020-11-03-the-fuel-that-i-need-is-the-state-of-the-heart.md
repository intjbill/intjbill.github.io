Last night, my willpower finally reached its end and my new streak restart lasted less than a day!  I think the holiday's festivities zapped everything and I had a silly logic of "I ought to be rewarded for a 136-day streak."

I woke up this morning in the 3AM hour unassisted in a weird state of mind, weird in that I didn't know what to do, except I did NOT want to repeat what I did the night before.  

And I suddenly just felt disconnected...sometimes the 3 AM can be like that; it can be a lonely hour.

I began going full-on carnivore, thinking my lower calorie retro approach failed me, but midway, I realized that a simple solution to my retro diet would be a well-timed sugar-free Jello.

I didn't work out despite spending a moment on the treadmill, but moved to spent time in thought and in optimizing the kitchen for greater fitness.  It was likely for the best as my knuckles and ankle put it to good use.

Ultimately, all of this has nothing to do with food or workouts, but the passion of my heart—that drives behavior!

Below is my first stab at my **2021 Running Plan**.  I want #4 and #12, though I don't know what I want to do with the rest as of yet.  I may open up with #4.  Hopefully I can find something in Bartlett...
