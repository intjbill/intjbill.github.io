BLUCK

...perhaps there will come a time when I'll go off-the-grid and live a life not prescribed and molded by Silicon Valley, though as society moves closer to full-on Internet integration, being successful in that disconnected context is doubtful...not that people haven't thrived up to the 1990's, of course.  And really, do I want to thrive in this subjugated context?  I really don't buy into the social and bias media rollout.  Yes, I *think* I like to be connected, but connected to what?  

And the funny thing about people and their tribes—REGARDLESS of ideology, is that they all want you to think *their* way.  And whichever side of Us vs. Them you're rooting for, you're thinking I'm talking about Them. 

I've been reminded lately of my news intake—yep, since the American presidential election, I've actually given it a few, light glances, something I thought I swore off for the rest of 2020.  But, in my defense, I thought it would be for just a night, I'd know who was elected and that would be it.  And yet...but, this is the thing: what does it matter?  The powers who slap themselves around for *King of the Mountain* have nothing to do with me.  The more powerful one will win and I'll find out whenever I find out.
