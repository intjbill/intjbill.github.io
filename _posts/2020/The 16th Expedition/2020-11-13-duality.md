There's a weird space of hanging out in the 240 lb neighborhood.  On one hand, I've lost nearly 100 lbs, so on one level, I'm feeling confident and fitter.  Yet on the other side of the street, I'm far from being fit and lug around extra weight.  Early in my IT career, I was concerned when my weight *ballooned* up to 241.  Today, here I am, partly proud that I'm there again!

—briefly proud, anyway.  See, it's not something that I'd print on a t-shirt or even reference in passing.  I want *so much* more!  All of this is just part of an off-season training approach as I get ready for 2021.

And the funny thing is that specific weights don't hold the same luster for me anymore.  Sure, I'd like to pass 208 this year, thereby knocking out 2019's lightest weight, but I'm far more interested in establishing km/mi paces.

And while it may seem I've got the fireworks blasting over here, after losing a battle with a feral kitten, I have stayed behind to lick the wounds of my hands.  I've chosen extra sleep to accelerate the healing process since I don't want to damage my hands any further hitting the bag.  Most of the marks are little more than aggravated paper cuts, but I fear the poison applied to the blade.
