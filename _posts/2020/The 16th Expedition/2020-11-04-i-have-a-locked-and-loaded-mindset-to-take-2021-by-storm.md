While there was no workout today as I let the body return from a sore throat and continue its work on my ankle and knuckles, it did not mean my mind was on a beach somewhere!   I even ran for 3 minutes on the treadmill to get a good idea what mile pace I can sustain—it's just not never thought in those terms before—never been a goal of mine.

But, that will change in 2021!

I've on a Google exploration to run down or at least be influenced by a training schedule for running.  All I really know is that I find that the intermediate goal of a race puts some teeth on motivation!   In the beginning, I'll be targeting 5Ks, but it really depends on my progression as to what year end 2021 might look like.

I'd like to hit a 5K early in the year, but it depends if I'm sub 200 lbs.  Pushing the pace at 240 sucks—ESPECIALLY on a mending ankle!  I have a lot of confidence in my retro diet in its capability to get me there by EOY 2020, *especially* as I've re-introduced sugar-free jello as a hunger stopgap in the evenings.

Entering its 5th month, my beard is feeling especially EPIC today as I reapplied Just For Men's *M-40 Mustache & Beard Coloring*.  Adding coconut oil to it makes me think I'm a Viking whose longship got lost and wound up on some sandy beach with clear waters.
