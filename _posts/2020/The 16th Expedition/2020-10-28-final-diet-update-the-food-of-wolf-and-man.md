*(While I did not know today's song title would match my topic, I'm delighted by the parallels!)*

Diet changes abound!  "BILL!  Didn't you solidify things in your last post?"  Hardly!  Change, change, change!  And we're back at 1.  Or I should say The 7th?

From May 29 to October 1, 2019, I had lost weight in The 7th, 8th, and 9th Expeditions with losses of 43, 24 and 14.75 lbs.  I was frustrated that The 9th seemed so lowed especially as I put my daily work in my gym.

How did The 13th, 14th, and 15th fare? 24.25, 12 and 11.75 lbs?  I thought with the greater focus on daily training and renewed discipline on my carnivore diet that I would have something to show for it come weigh-in.  But, before that day some 5 weeks from now, I thought I'd better to do a quick check *just* to make sure I'm now headed in the right direction.  Nope.  Absolutely nope!  After six days, I've lost a pound.   *A single pound.*  2.5+ hour workouts M-F and staying atop whatever diet I chose and that's all I've got!

Something concerned me last night:  while my day was simple of just eggs, ground beef, water, and salt, I felt nauseated as I lay in bed at night.  I also was fatigued late afternoon into the night.  When I woke up at 3 whatever this morning, as I looked deeply into the sole light of the candle triad, I knew I had to make a fundamental break from what I've been doing for the last 132 days:  I'm going retro!  I'm going back to the diet where I lost silly amounts of weight.  Yes, it cannot withstand *The Bump* but can any diet withstand the onslaught after its stoppage?

Look, there was nothing wrong with my past diet; if I had followed it up for Expeditions 13 - 15, I would already be knocking at the door or under 200, like I was this time in 2019.  As I've said for years, I need a solid exit strategy, and when its time, I believe I have it through keto.  It's delightful for maintenance, but I know I can lose weight faster with my own diet.

What does it look like right now?

## Breakfast Smoothie (post workout)

## Nutrition & Carbs

At 1006 kcal, the diet hits all the RDAs and amino acids sans choline, which is at 98%.  Another egg would have fixed it, but I didn't find it particularly compelling.  Net carbs is at 26 grams while and fiber is 50 grams.  While ketogenic, it's not "keto" as it relates to macro numbers—47% fat vs 70%; all of its fiber yanks up the total carb value to 28% vs 5%, but eating mummy wrappings will do that! If macros mattered, it would have mattered!

I still believe in a low carb approach (CLEARLY), but the great thing about dieting is that there all sorts of ways to achieve that end.  And 5 weeks, we'll just see if [that slope of my weigh-in](/fit/#all-results) will drastically change! Not weighing in until then—that's how confidant I am in the success of this diet!

## Going Retro

Along with its diet, let's bring back the music of *The Lost 7th Expedition*
