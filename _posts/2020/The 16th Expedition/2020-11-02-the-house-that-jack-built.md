After 136 days, my Diet Streak has been snapped!  Now, wait a minute—I wasn't conscious of it in the moment.  It makes for a great teaching moment on the use of commas.  For example, someone might offer you a Sonic Sugar-Free Raspberry Slush or a Sugar-Free, Raspberry Slush.

Now, in the first example, the modifiers come off a bit clunky: is the syrup sugar-free or is the entire drink sugar-free?

Clearly, the second example indicates that the slush is—if true; it **wasn't!**  Perhaps, the reality could have been better stated as a Sonic Slush with Sugar-Free Raspberry Syrup...however, I did not work through those terms as I kept asking myself why this "sugar-free" drink was WAY too sweet.  I'm a stevia guy—I know the expectations!  I didn't do my [due diligence](https://www.mashed.com/157440/dont-eat-a-sonic-slush-until-you-read-this/) until midway through the drink.

So, the streak is snapped at 136.5 days.  But, I *knew* I couldn't pile on. Hey, I survived the tempestuous calorie cascades of the *Candy Holiday*, I can push on!  It's amusing that I tripped on the *other* side.  

My will is intact, even if I'm a little frustrated.  But, hey, it's great to post to the top of my HIGH SCORE list and slam another quarter into the machine with this renewed, retro diet.  As it stands:

## HIGH SCORE

* 136D1200
* 116D1200
* 92D0000
* 86D0000

## Today's Workout

My workout was crippled because of my choice to not have contact with the bag as I let my bruised & blistered right knuckles heal up—it feels fine, but I thought it might be prudent to literally take a step back.  I tried to still maintain the same routine, just with more shadowboxing, but 2/3's in my left ankle was tweaking (again!), so I closed out with the elliptical.

That said, during the fifteen 3:00/1:00 minute intervals, I both solidified an ab routine and added three minutes on my vertical climber, a [Maxiclimber](https://maxiclimber.com/).  Up to this point, I haven't been on the machine in 2020 as I've just been too heavy.  While weighing in at 243 five days ago, confident with the potential weightloss of my retro diet, I climbed aboard my vertical climber knowing I didn't exceed its 240 lb weight limit.

Whew!  While generally I feel lighter in most every other application, a vertical climber for 3 minutes provides fantastic feedback!
