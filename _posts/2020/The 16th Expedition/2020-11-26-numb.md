While I only hesitantly proclaim this, I have SMASHED the weightloss gridlock!  OK, so we'll see tomorrow if this trend continues and then I'm DONE with weighing in until the end of The 16th Expedition—it's just under a week away!  A 6-week weigh-in approach is the superior approach once a diet is established.

I'm less than a couple of pounds away from reaching the lowest weight for 2020.  I don't know how valid it was: from March 7 to April 20, I went from 271 to 277 lbs, but along the way I hit 237. * *shrug* *  The 11th Expedition is a lesson on how a low-calorie approach fails—you CANNOT out-calculate your body!  

Of course, as [the graph shows](/fit/#all-results), my weight shot up to 292 until I went keto on June 18 until going full carnivore just days ago on November 23.

And true to form, [The 11th Expedition's playlist](https://open.spotify.com/playlist/3O7PHeJgMXS7EGHwh83ryv?si=_Mn7FE6aQR2xGl70BVTPZQ) was all over the place, a buffet of exploration on everything from angst to *The Office*.

## Thanksgiving

And while today is Thanksgiving, it doesn't feel like the day I once knew.  I'm not surrounded by this weird obsession of gluttony.  I mean, I'm not exactly sure how chomping and chortling carbs down the gullet en masse is a posture of being thankful.  That said, the revolting overindulgence is congruent with the massive shopping spree followup.

I'm thankful for the little things, little things that are packed with content and context.

I'll share this picture I took this morning, a Jackson thrift store find mug that's advertising a *Handy Map Street Atlas* of Memphis.  It is the crossroads I thrived to drive across in those early years of college around '96-'97 on a mug that is at LEAST that old.

...and I love candles and the fire within.
