Despite living for the past five years just ten minutes away from a state park, I've never spent a substantive amount of time there, unlike that time I lived an hour away from the Grand Canyon. Sure, campers and RV'ers come from all over region for its solace, but I just didn't go...until now.  As I investigate places that I can train, I recognize that it's more change being brought from my upcoming 2021 Running season.

After investing my daily, 10,000-step goal there, I found that while its root-laden trails will encourage walking, there are some elements that will lead to bursts of calf work.  And there's plenty of asphalt for roadwork! 

And while I don't have the stamina to put in substantive amount of running into my program, I am working and planning toward that outcome.  You gotta do the research to rock the world!
