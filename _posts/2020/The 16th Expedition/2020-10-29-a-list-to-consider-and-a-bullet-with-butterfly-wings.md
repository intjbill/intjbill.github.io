It's the first full day since returning to my retro diet and I *feel fantastic!*  OK, so yesterday could have been the first day, but the insight didn't hit me until *after* I had a MCT/butter coffee.  Of course, it's too soon to make commentary on energy levels, but if I experience what I did in 2018 and 2019, I should not feel any drop in my workouts with the reduced caloric intake.

I return to [Todoist](https://todoist.com/) after spending most of October and then some on Habitica.  Again, while I like the *idea* of Habitica, its gamification execution fails to pass the starting level—I've written enough about that already in past posts!  Oh, disappointment!  As far as actual needs go, I just want something that I can quickly jot into as a reminder before my thoughts move on to something else.  OK, *maybe* there's something more to it...

...I want to think about New Year Resolutions for 2021 and the steps required to reach them.  It's rather freeing, this dreaming process.  The potential of possibilities can be mesmerizing. To Do lists are more than taking out the trash or points to hit during gym time.  To Do lists can be the scaffolding to dreams that take a starward leap into the abyss.
