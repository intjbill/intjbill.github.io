Steak.  Mmm...I am lovin' it! I continue to explore how to detect actual hunger vs. baseless whispers.   So far, I **know** when I'm HUNGRY. Like, "Get outta my way, I gotta FEAST!"  But, in those moments where there is just a slight perception of a suggestion, it's hard for me to determine where that proposal is coming from.  It's getting a whiff of a Cinnabon or walking by a pizzeria: before that, you're not in the mood, but now, it's like, "Dude, get on that now!"

I don't trust those feelings.  And again, it's why I like my carnivore approach, ESPECIALLY with the daily ground beef.  With a well-established daily ritual, it's easier to hear the needs of my body over the flighty passions of that guy whom hops into the cockpit and locks the door when my back is turned.  

It's compounded by my workouts.  If I work out, I gotta throw in an extra meal apparently.  Otherwise, I've seemed to have fallen into a two-a-day eating construct...though, again, I'm not following a schedule.  Otherwise we eat because, "Look what time it is again!"

Now, when I do eat, it's about no-holds-barred throwing back all the meat!  Gotta be satiated.  It's all about giving the body what it wants.

The other day, I posted a picture of a mug avertising a *Handy Map Street Atlas* of Memphis.  Today, I share a picture of another favorite mug.

And again:  "I love candles and the fire within."
