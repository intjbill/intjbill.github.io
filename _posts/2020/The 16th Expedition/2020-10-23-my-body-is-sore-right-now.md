While I applaud my 4-6:35 AM session this morning, what is it with 42 where I am just piling up the tweaks?  Yesterday, I was sensitive to my left foot and left knee.  Today, its the inner side of my left heel and my right knee.  Oh, and I've got a crazy bruise on my right elbow that is a sensitive to the touch.

I guess I'll just chalk it all up as part of the process.

And I do *love* the process!

No where do I feel the most alive as I do when I work out.  It's very visceral!  While my hour cardio is just a wakeup/warmup for my striking as I watched old UFC fights, my time with the bag has been special as I listen to my "newly" crafted, 42-song playlist for *The 16th Edition*.  I've chosen to train to its playing for each striking session until December 3...

...ah, the Christmas season.  It seems so far away but it's nearly here!  

With great anticipation, I look forward to that New Year's Eve, the gateway to a very special 2021.  I ought to pull together a resolutions list, shouldn't I?  Honestly, I look forward to talking to friends again.  I've been off social media for years now and lost touch with...well, pretty much EVERYBODY!  I gotta change that...maybe 2021 will feature a few games at the Liberty Bowl with my beloved Tigers on the field and in the stands.
