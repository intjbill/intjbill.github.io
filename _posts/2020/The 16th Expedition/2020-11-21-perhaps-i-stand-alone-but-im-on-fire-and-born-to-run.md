Lately, everything has been feeling hollow.  Why do I tinker with diet optimization?  Why do I train? (*Admittedly, I LONG to thump that jab out as I continue to be down due to this core injury.*)  Why do I pull together into words that which runs through my consciousness?  

Perhaps, it's this time in the wilderness that makes me re-evaluate design.  In a context of being out in the country; years and half-a-world away; and not on social media, I just have the memories of friends—I know, this sounds more despondent than I intend.  But, it's like this:  I *know* I have memories that are not mine alone.  There are others that share them.  But, why does it feel like now they are just mine?  I mean, yes, if I was in my 80s-90s, this construct might be valid, but like Vedder sang, "Hey, I, oh I'm still alive!" And it's not much of a leap for me to make that they are thriving as well—I hope!  It would be statistically significant if they were not.

2021 awaits.  Change is coming.
