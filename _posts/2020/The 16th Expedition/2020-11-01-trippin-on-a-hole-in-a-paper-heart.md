Hello Destiny!  Time Travelers—how are you all doin' tonight?!  And here's to all those crazies out in Posterity Land!  Woo!

OK, I had a Paul Stanley on a KISS Alive album thing going on in my head there!

SURPRISE—this site doesn't get much traffic; most of the Internet works this way. This is NOT some silly *Self-Care Is Your #1 Care for 2020* or *Top 10 Songs To Dance To Make Your Beard More Epic* or *Top Movies for All-Time That Begin With a "The"* website.  This is just me—NO "get rich schemes" of bait clicks or ad monetization or Amazon affiliate links—*in fact*, I don't even own an Amazon account!

I preferred the Internet back when it was a place where people were just interested in stuff—geeks and such, some time around 1995-1997...but, I suspect that's just me being exclusive...

...we live in an inclusive world, though rarely do we recognize it.  There are the Internet giants that have been able to pull off millions of mouse-clicks.  But, whether its our lives in the present, others in 1976, still others from 1876, or even those around 76 AD and before, we are people, people that are people: we all have wins, losses and a desire for something *better*.

There's no magic in fame or wealth—a few lucky breaks hit that could have easily missed...should luck be followed?  Should followers and fortune be a target?  I don't think I want that as a metric.  After that 150 mark,  those numbers in our lives don't matter much, and I *want* people in my life to matter.
