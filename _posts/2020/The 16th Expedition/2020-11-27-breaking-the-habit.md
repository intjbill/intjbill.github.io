A new day and we are marching toward Christmas and beyond!  I expect these upcoming weeks to be transformative.

I'm practicing at reading my body this morning.  Instead of immediately grabbing the beef from the freezer for defrosting, I asked the crucial question, "Am I hungry?"

Sure, OF COURSE, I *can* eat—I'm not asking if I have the capacity to eat.  What I want to do is differentiate schedule from desire.  I'm disinterested in following anything, whether an eating routine or amounts.  As long as I'm eating beef and eggs sometime when that low fuel light pops on, I'm good.  In a context of punting the intermittent fasting construct aside,  I don't eat because I haven't been hungry; it's around 9 AM now and I haven't eaten since 1:30 PM yesterday.  I can attribute it to my removing salts & seasonings from this carnivore diet.  I agree with others that a blander approach doesn't stir up fanciful eating.

It's pretty simple:  when I'm hungry, I eat.  The only way a diet will work is if its sustainable.  Being miserable is a dealbreaker.  Eating as much as I want is critical.  Understanding that feeling, both in target and time is key.
