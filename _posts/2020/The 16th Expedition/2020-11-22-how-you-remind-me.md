Today is the start of many firsts.  Until New Year's Eve, my diet is so simple a caveman DID it.  Meat, eggs, and water.  

* If it came from a root, it's to boot! 
* No salt or *No Salt* potassium chloride.  
* No artificial things cooked up by a guy in a lab coat.
* No dairy.

Just...

Meat.

Eggs.

Water.

I *think* I got that one in my head.  Of course, I've referenced a similar diet, but I had ushered in diet drinks, MCT oil, butter, and caffeine, finding that my weight in November basically remains unchanged, oscillating between 239 and 241, regardless of calorie intake—I don't even track it anymore!  Yeah, that reduced calorie hypothesis for weight loss is SO blown out of the water...the math just doesn't work.  

So, I'm going to apply something that's basically an elimination diet to figure out why I'm not losing further weight.  Perhaps things that taste like sugar jack up the process?  Perhaps it's a response to milk?  I don't suspect it's caffeine, but once I capture weightloss momentum again, I'll reintroduce coffee or tea.  I have been thinking about loose leaf tea, my graduate school through Alaska friend.  In my time at Sitka and Anchorage, [Upton Tea](https://www.uptontea.com/) was a warm companion.

This conservative approach is not for a walk in the park, but the run in a race.  Yes, the Christmas season is soon upon us with all the sugar cookies, fudges, eggnogs and candy canes of years' past.  However, I'm not training my heart and my body to be Buddy the Elf.

2021 lies ahead.
