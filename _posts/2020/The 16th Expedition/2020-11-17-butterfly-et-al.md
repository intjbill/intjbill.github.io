You might have noticed that I took a "break" from this site.  OK, so I gave the appearance of a complete site shutdown!  Momentarily, I considered a return to WordPress.  (Once again) I also made a strong push to leave Google, but as I received reports that Google was labeling my ProtonMail email as *dangerous*...well...I'm back..."The Matrix Has (Me)," right?

I just *wish* I found out sooner before running through a factory reset on my phone and thriving in a world without a Google account!

Nevertheless, I'm back...and have a laundry list of websites I gotta go back and update.

Yet the biggest impact of leaving Google for me wasn't in losing my Google One access, Google Sheet use, or YouTube customization; the biggest shift I saw was in my sudden cessation in the gym.   I did not work out one time!

That's gonna change...that's GOTTA change!

And it has...today, according to my Nike Run Club app, my hike at the state park today went for 7 km.  I haven't hammered out my new routine as of yet, but if fits into the schema:

* **Monday** - Weights (Back) & Bagwork
* **Tuesday** - Run / Walk / Hike 
* **Wednesday** - Weights (Chest) & Bagwork
* **Thursday** - Run / Walk / Hike
* **Friday** - Weights (Shoulders) & Bagwork
* **Saturday** - Run / Walk / Hike
* **Sunday** - Run / Walk / Hike

Spring 2021, as Dead or Alive once sang, "Watch out here I come!"

**"...To stretch out my arms like Wolverine and rail against the tempest of Death."**
