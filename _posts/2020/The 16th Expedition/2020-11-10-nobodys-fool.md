For the last week in a context of daily workouts, I ate 1,821 calories a day and...GAINED a pound!

Again, it really underscores how the energy-in / energy-out fails to provide weightloss.

No, there's gotta be something more fundamental about reaching my weight than some sort of silly, *created* paradigm.  It is NOT about the calories a lab technician records from yesterday's furnace or today's calculator!

What is being overweight?  It's having more energy stored for the winter than what is required. People ate with the availability of food, knowing the uncertainity of tomorrow.   It's what people have always done when successful hunts became fewer.

Why was it that people were fit and didn't track while not having access to today's tools of micronutrient tracking?

A LOT is packed in that question, and you could have an entire library devoted to answering it.  For a quick, 40,000 flyover, I'll say that foods weren't manufactured and people ate what they liked until they were done eating.  I heard something off of the Joe Rogan podcast with Paul Saladino, about a *meat*-based diet.  It was a simple logic:  we can just about eat any animal we run across, but if we do the same with plants, we're gonna be in a world of hurt.  In that context, our genes likely won't make it into the next generation.

I mean, it makes sense.  Animals can fight and flee.  Plants are kinda...well, STUCK.  Yes, they want us to distribute their seeds, but do they seriously want us to eat their leaves, roots, or even their seeds?  

Just maybe what everyone labels as nutritious just might not be...I think that's the biggest thing I've grown weary of is the groupthink that moves toward power like a moth to the flame.  In today's image/brand obsessed culture, it's particularity egregious.  Who are you when you are disconnected from tech?

All of that aside, for the next three weeks, I'm going to give a carnivore approach a fair shake.  Until *The 16th Expedition's* weigh-in, I'm just going to eat meat; eggs; salt (and potassium chloride); butter and water.  Weigh-in and evaluate on December 3.

Let's roll: no sweeteners, no coffee, no plant oils—let's just cover it all: **NO PLANTS**.  I may even hug a tree! 

I'll likely eat 1 or 2 times a day based on hunger.  I'm benching my Cronometer use because I don't want to be governed by daily nutritional goals, feeling I *have* to eat something to hit a manufactured target.

And with that, I drink my last Bulletproof Coffee.
