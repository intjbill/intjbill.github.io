You know what is *not* particularly inspiring?  The realization that it is a resistance day with a set of iron from the cold forges of Wintergrasp to be lifted in a gym space that has transformed magically into a winter wonderland.

As much as I like on paper the schema I laid out yesterday, I just don't feel compelled to meet the morning at 3-whatever AM...the thing about these workouts is that they GOTTA be something that I look forward to as the best part of my day.  If I see it as a detractor, how long *can* I maintain the willpower to keep both it and the parameters of my diet?

There are long range things out on the horizon that drive our behavior, but we also work within the day-to-day; one pillar is rock solid, of course, but dailies gotta be reworked!  

I'll likely return to my morning cardio regimen.  Honestly, at this weight, I'm not ready for the lower leg wear that a running regimen would delve out; a 4-day approach can be shelved for later use.
