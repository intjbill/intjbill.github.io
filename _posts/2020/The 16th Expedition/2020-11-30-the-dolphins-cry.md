I'm now into my 2nd week of being a carnivore with this zero carb (ZC) approach. Leading up to it was a little over 22 weeks of keto.

While they are always optional, I'm taking coffee and eggs out of my daily diet.  I skipped coffee yesterday—just wasn't in the mood; I'm curious as how I'll feel after a week with this break from eggs.

So to sum up, it's just beef and water.   No salt, seasonings or dairy, either!  As it has been sung, "You may be right: I may be crazy. But it just may be a lunatic you're looking for!"

Of course, it *sounds* crazy, this devil may care approach to eating, disregarding authoritative instructions as to the **"right"** way of eating and choosing instead to thunder into the night down my own road like others in my tribe. I renounce the spans in 2004-2005 and recent years when I was a vegan. While I had hopeful and meaningful intent with veganism, THAT was DUMB.  Ultimately, it pushed me further from my dreams.  Today, I eat REAL food; it brings me joy!

OK, so I should say I'm coming off a steak high.  Last night, for the first time in my life, I cooked a ribeye.  Clearly, I'm a bit of a novice, but I broiled 5 minutes on one side and 5 on the other.  While satisfied with the result ESPECIALLY in the context of hunger, I look forward to attempting a [reverse sear](https://www.seriouseats.com/2017/03/how-to-reverse-sear-best-way-to-cook-steak.html).

Last night's dinner was a 12 oz ribeye, which runs $6 at the grocery, a price that makes me balk a little compared to the $1.58/lb sale of ground beef that's in my freezer.  I could justify it as an occasional treat and when compared to fast food...well, let's just say the qualitative comparison weighs far greater on the steak side.  

I ate my steak, was content, and had nothing else for the night.  Earlier that day, I had 1 lb of ground beef around 11:30 AM with 3 eggs.

It's that simple.
