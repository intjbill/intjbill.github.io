Before I begin, I'm sharing an unedited clip of the video project I've referenced in a prior post.  For the past several weeks, I've recorded a small sample of the hour-long striking routine that I do, to show the eventual evolution of me, that will be edited down to 3 or 4 minutes tops—maybe a second or two per day?  Y

Thus, [here I am for today around 4:45 AM](https://photos.app.goo.gl/EjZqg1FADP16g7hQ9).  

Just another run-of-the-mill workout for me this morning, one in which I intentionally dialed back the intensity as I formulate a weekly workout plan that's evolving to include a running regimen while being sensitive to this ailing ankle.  I mean, this ankle is fine for most applications, but my two-hour workouts leave it in a weakened state each morning.

Thus, I want to find some way to provide the intensity while opening up the opportunity for *more*,  In that vein, I may do *less*...in a way...as one level drops, another rises...

As much as I enjoy watching old UFC fights, I may set it aside to use the freed up resources for another app.  More importantly, I'll likely move away from my long elliptical/walking sessions as I continue to develop.  And as I drop weight, add intensity, and decrease low-intensity erosion, I suspect these nagging tweaks will evaporate.  

Of course, as we're entering the winter months, I'm unsure if my transition to a park mindset is as applicable as I'd like...yet, that's the direction I'm ultimately headed with dates circled across the calendar's pages...
