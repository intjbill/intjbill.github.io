I'm back!  Admittedly, I've dabbled between self-hosting with Wordpress and Jekyll powered by GitHub Pages—YES, I was standards non-compliant! The tricky thing about providing your own standards page is the knowledge that it can be altered with a text editor!

Yet, it's not the oscillation as to why I haven't posted recently.  Technically, yesterday, I've posted ALL sorts of content like 264 posts!  I scoured the Internet in search of everything I've written on my websites.  Sadly, I don't have the majority of it.  Outside of merely THREE posts, I have absolutely nothing from 2005 to 2016.  And as far as journals prior from 1990 to 2001—well, there's another lost decade—or even my 60-page, single-spaced typed journal from my first time in Europe back in 2004...all of it spanning back from a hard drive failure in that move from Alaska.  

That said, I recovered a pivotal period of my life with the Wayback Machine and I'm kicking myself that I moved on to Wordpress.

## Floating Apart from Associations and Awareness

I haven't been engaged with my fitness approach.  With the exception of today, there have been no early mornings.  Even today, I spent only about 20 minutes on the treadmill as a reminder how I find the spoken word as a COMPLETE WORKOUT WRECKER.  I **cannot** work out to audiobooks and podcasts.  I just can't!  It's my kryptonite!  As I engage my mind, it's like I take a couple steps back from my connection to the physical world.

And hey, my Vibrams were reeking of past success, so I gotta run them through a bleach cycle before adoring them in adorning.

Overall, I haven't been charged to cut the weight as I was in the past...that changes today.  Is it a light switch?   I think so:  movies do it all the time; songs regularly ping pong our emotions across our cognitive array.

Critical to my success is the awareness of my activities.  Where my diet tracking is right on the market, I have been largely indifferent to my physical status—I haven't monitored and reacted to my daily steps and haven't thought about my minutes spent in workouts since The 11th Expedition...and as I'm nearly at the halfway point of The 15th Expedition, that's gotta change!

Time to crack out my hero outfit.  The super one is on layaway.
