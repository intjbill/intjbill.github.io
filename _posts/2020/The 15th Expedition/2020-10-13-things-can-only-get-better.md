*Past Me* gifted an appropriate title over to me for today's post.  I only put in 50 minutes into my workout this morning.  Initially, I had something tweak on my left ankle on the treadmill, so I switched to the elliptical.  Eventually, I flipped back and just had no energy and my left big toe felt buggered, so I figured I'd take a mid-workout breakfast.  Ten minutes later, my toe was still bothering me so I cut things short.

Normally, I might have swung over to the bag, though my gloves are still in transmit.  And as far as lifting goes, I'm both moving away from its application and I just felt tapped.  Evening cardio, a late night, a diet shift, and a too early wake-up can wreck a morning workout.

So, we're at the outset of a third 116-day adventure, one that will not only go beyond my personal best weigh-for The Expeditions, but will also bring down to levels I haven't seen since 2005.  From there, it is the the gateway to the 1990's.  

While this pre-dawn morning groans, it is the start of something really special.
