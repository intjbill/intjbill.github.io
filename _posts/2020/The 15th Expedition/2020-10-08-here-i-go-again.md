While I've selected the titles to my blog posts at the outset of *The 15th Expedition*,  appropriately, this title also applies to my fitness regimen!

After some light tests, I'm going to go ahead and green light my workout for Friday morning, a workout that will definitely open up with stretching!

Vlog #5 is available! (UPDATE: Link retired!) I'm hanging out in my backyard, which takes on a *whole* different meaning outside the confines of  surburbia.  My beard just might be vaulting me to *Duck Dynasty* status.

I just made a purchase of black & red [Sanabul training gloves](https://sanabulsports.com/collections/striking-equipment/products/gel-boxing-gloves-essential#).  While I really like my MMA gloves, they are far too lightweight for my bag training.  I basically get 1 or 2 training sessions out of them before my knuckles are wrecked for the week, so I decided to go with 16 oz Sanabul so that I can have better workouts.  Don't get me wrong—it hasn't been all bad:  my elbow striking game is KILLER!

While I'm not emphasizing resistance training, I really want to amp up my striking.  There's something about functional fitness that I find irresistible, and why my time on an elliptical is just...*weird*.  I get my treadmill because if I could ever visit a place with with a level ground without a  hole in the ground caused by some varmint or stick or two, I suspect a treadmill might mimic it.
