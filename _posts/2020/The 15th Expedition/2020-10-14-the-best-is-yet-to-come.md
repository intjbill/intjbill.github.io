I shot the briefest summary this morning to make VBLOG #6! (UPDATE: Link retired!) And yes, I said "VBLOG".  I dunno, vlog just comes off like a virtual host system log to me.  * *shrug* *  I mean, it's already shortened enough from web log, right?  I may be alone on this one...just where I want to be!

I did my old diet all of 1 day and realized it sucks.  It reminded me of what a monumental effort it was to achieve 86, 90, and 116-day streaks eating it!  The final turnoff was my attempt at a soybean chocolate pudding with sunflower seeds.  Great texture, but it left the impression on me as to what prop food might taste like on a set.  

Plus, I'm really curious as to what it might like to go all-medieval—wait, all carnivore...well, all carnivore with dairy.  I am replacing coconut oil for cooking with butter and there will be no coffee—clearly, this is in the short term!  I'm staying with gelatin, so artificial sweeteners remain in play (even stevia), but its really a matter of finding what best keeps me powered up.

Yesterday after sundown, I received my bag gloves!  I was so stoked to have received them and punched off a good workout this morning with many more to follow!
