I did not work out this morning.  I even woke up pre-4AM, but figured it would be more beneficial if I allocated more time to the work teams to fix my right knee.  More on this topic with Vlog #4. (UPDATE: Link retired!)

I installed [OpenShot](https://www.openshot.org/) to reduce the filesize for my purposes.  I dropped it from 326 MB to 138 MB while maintaining 1080p by just using its presets for YouTube HD—not that I'm posting to that specific platform, though it is the underlying tech on Google Photos.  

It has been YEARS since I used OpenShot.  The last time I did, this song was on my iPod: [Linkin Park's *Leave Out the Rest*](https://open.spotify.com/track/0sp00HSXkQyqTa6QqM0O8V?si=jQiHxd9gRNWbHgWHhAt5sQ) from *Twilight*.

I'd post my videos to YouTube if that platform wasn't so...icky.  Branding, self-promotion, monetization, analytics—may I release a * sigh * at this point? I do this website because it's a fun hobby; it lets me play around with tech; and it serves (I hope) as a backup to some of the things that were on my mind as the years go by.  AND, it gives me another outlet to wrestle with an idea and optimize other areas!

People speak of *millions* of followers; honestly, I was uncomfortable years ago when my Facebook list of friends reached beyond 120.  For that matter, I don't like it when LastPass reaches 40 sites.

Overall, maybe all of this has to do with my proclivity toward optimization and to that end, my desire to cut out things that get in the way.  Take for example browser caching:  it's great for increased speeds on a computer, but when improperly managed leads to out-of-date information and to its logical end, the eventual shutdown of a system.  I see the *more, more, more* mindset to be EXACTLY this, whether money or fame.

Take for example someone with 1 million followers: it's paltry compared with The Rock's 199 million, but it's a baseline.  For a friendship, how much time do we need to feed it each week to keep it healthy?  Since, I have no idea I'll just throw out another number:  10 minutes.  With just 1 million followers, how long would it take to spend JUST 10 minutes with each person?  19 years.  Again, the pursuit of money and/or fame leads to out-of-date information and the eventual shutdown of a system.

And while I consider suggesting another OST, this song feels right today: [Nach Deutschland](https://open.spotify.com/track/52yEDYuYPTV39d3St8ady5?si=jYFKgpxhRUyUguU7HA_GUA)
