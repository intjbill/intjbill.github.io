While the content is more of a status update and not particularly insightful as it leans on the obvious, Vlog #3 is out! (UPDATE: Link retired!)

Admittedly, I'm kicking myself (just not with *that* leg).  I could make the argument against resistance training altogether with *What If* analysis, but, armchair quarterbacking is never applicable, encouraging or even helpful!

The funny thing is that I'm usually mindful of warmup and stretching, but I gotta admit, I was just pumped up this morning to put my work in! 

And while I am now dealing with a limp, if it's the same tomorrow, it's cool, I'll just shift my focus back to meditation, something I've set aside and would be interested in picking back up again—it's not exactly something I can mine for vlog content—what do I know, maybe it's EXACTLY that!  Now, relatable content...that's another matter altogether!  The point is that whatever happens, shake it off and move.

Of course, *relatable* content, would seem to indicate that I know to whom I am relating...and the answer is that I'm pretty sure I am talking to myself.  It is the dilemma of us who dwell disconnected in the digital wilderness.

It amuses me how we're forever looking back and looking forward while failing to realize we are simultaneously both the past and the future.
