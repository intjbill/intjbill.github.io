Today is a special post!  It's the very last day of *The 15th Expedition!* As such, I now release its playlist, [The 15th Expedition: the New Prologue](https://open.spotify.com/playlist/5UUmmDu7QI3kGN42xrvshh?si=7_xoWK65Tm-UhCQeRWnxtA), based off songs that I pulled from The Radio of Bill.

The theme/insight?  Duality?

> In the air tonight into the vast, the only living boy in New York.  Burning man: it's my life.  I remember you—extreme ways!  You are the wilderness, the world I know, so far away.
>
> Here I go again...how's it going to be?  Sure know something:  walking in Memphis, with or without you, things can only get better; the best is yet to come.
>
> In the meantime, this is how we do it:  somewhere out there, smile, step out, reach out, I'll be there. Right here.

"But wait, there's more!:"

A video update: VLOG #7 (UPDATE: Link retired!)

*(OK, so I don't know what to do with the convention of VLOG vs VBLOG—I've already shared my thoughts on the matter, PLUS, I like the GTA radio station feel of V-ROCK.  But do I desire to be different just to be different?)*
