After six days of daily workouts, I enter rest.  Admittedly, I'm tempted to put another session in; I just feel good!  Yet, there's no need to rush it:  I've got six more days in the queue.

This week will feature the kickoff to The 16th Expedition. I look forward to Thursday's weigh-in though the results matter not.  I've now reached a place in my fitness schema where I just *want* to move and be active.  It's not a requirement or anything; far from it, it's a DELIGHT!  This brings me hope, specifically that if I feel this way now, that Future Me's activity will be a greater extension of this.

At this point, the number on the scale is important in that it shows me the potential of greater success.  I enjoy my workouts today;  in the upcoming months, I'll be moving more adroitly.  I long to return to those days of years ago, my '90s, when I'd take off running at night at this time of year and just didn't fatigue.

So much is lost to the past, but I believe that this thing can be recovered.  It makes me smile.
