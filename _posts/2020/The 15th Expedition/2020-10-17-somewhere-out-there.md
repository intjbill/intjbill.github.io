My life is quiet.  I live a simple life.  There's a world out there with all sorts of activity with emotions that climb the heights, plunge into the depths, or hang out at some middle plane. From what I understand in my sabbatical from the news, 2020 has been about a lot of uncorked emotion. 

Is this good?  I cannot say for society and frankly am largely indifferent.  I *do* know that for as long as people have been around, they've wanted that green grass on the *other* side of the fence.   In context to an environment of virtual magnetization of followers, I suppose with today's marketers and their hyper-whetting the appetites of their targets, maybe unmet desire is fueled at a greater rate.  Frustration inevitably follows.

But, I cast all that aside.  My observations in of any beyond my own scope, has little practicality.  Again, my life is quiet and I try to squash that nasty bug of materialism when he squirms into my life.  The problem with want is that it's never quenched by stuff.  

As far as emotions go, they are a knife.   They can be constructive or devastating.  Lately, I've been tapping into emotions and using them for my workouts.  Training sometimes can come off without focus as the approach is little more than time spent on a hamster wheel.  And while putting in the work is good, it can be *better*.  Instead of merely running through my paces, what if I add a little zing to each strike?

Of course, I look out to 2021 and I find its potential to be both mesmerizing and the reason I step with gusto into my gym space each morning.  I know one day, somewhere out there, I'll reach that self-actualization moment.
