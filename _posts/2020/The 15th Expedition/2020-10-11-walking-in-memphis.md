I see a 2021 when I make a return to Memphis in some sort of fitness capacity.  For the past seven years, I've envisioned a running schema in my return, a return to what I do not know; whether I enter races in 2021 or regularly drive in to town to train, I don't know.  I have visualized this specific spring time for years:  the rustle of the leaves with the swaying of branches; the cool breeze glancing across my face; the warm of the sun enshrouding me; and the green leaves framing the skyline. 

While everything is at its preliminary stages, I'm considering on my first step forward on April 10, 2021.  It'll be the first Saturday of The 20th Expedition.  It's also 180 days away, giving me ample time to reach goal weight and establish cardio.

As it is something I have seen for years, I am thrilled at its upcoming realization.
