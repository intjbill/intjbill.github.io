I write from my new Lenovo IdeaCentre A540 Series, an all-in-one computer with attractive design elements.  The wireless charging station atop for my phone is a nice touch; while I've known about the tech for awhile, it was fun to see for the first time.  Admittedly, this new computer does diverge nicely from the crumbled remains of my HP laptop.

More importantly, I am no longer compelled to use thin clients from Google, but apply them in a supplementation capacity.  AND, I have time to think about what standards are best to be applied come winter.  I don't have a good solution for online mindmapping and it's hard to beat Gnucash for personal budgeting.  Plus, I can get back to a hobby of mine of learning Python through Udemy!

All that aside, it did compel me to consider seriously a centralized approach, something I wish I maintained from a decade ago.  But, unless I can find the keys to that DeLorean, I cannot resolve my move away from Dropbox. That said, yesterday, I subscribed to Google One for $1.99/month so that I can begin the very (and painful) march to backing up my data to a 3rd-party server.  I hear rumors that in the next **THREE YEARS** the local utilities provider will dig a trench in front of my house to lay fiber, but for now, my cracked screen iPad with an LTE antenna serves as my Internet modem, well, until I hit Verizon's 15 GB limit, making my phone serve up the slack.

So there's no Vlog today because there was no workout today—yet!  I don't know what happened:  I set up my FitBit for a smartwake alarm for 4AM and woke up unassisted at 5:52AM.  The thing is, I was *really* looking forward to this morning because outside of a good mopping and scrub down, my gym is green-lighted.  And while I intend to pick up a streamlined session later today, the rest of my day is thrown out-of-kilter in the workout's absence.  There's no morning surge of activity.

Do I blame myself or the tech?  Clearly, me!  I could have set a backup with my phone or create a daily schedule with my FitBit.  It's far too easy to blame tech or have an *ANYBODY Else But Me* mindset, but you know better.  I'm responsible for the processes, and frankly, this is the price I pay for late nights and a failure of implementation.
