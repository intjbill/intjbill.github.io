I start today with 200 days remaining for 2020. What will I do with those days?

There have been many 200s before. They come into an environment with vague parameters and no tracking, just optimism for a positive shift. They are all painted over by lethargic, ashen brushstrokes.

Where I once pinned a hope onto 2020 for a breakout year, instead, the 55% remaining will be a year of investment into my capabilities, whether in physical fitness or mental prowess. It's far too easy to reach our 40s and glide down the rest of our life.

We are not locked down; our brains don't solidify into a concrete mass. There is so much more that's out there...
