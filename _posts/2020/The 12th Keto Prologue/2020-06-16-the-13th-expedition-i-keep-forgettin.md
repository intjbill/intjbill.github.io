The 13th start has been...unlucky? I'd reject this tired cliche if I haven't worn it time and again—even after my failed re-branding of a Milestone system. No, I'm GOTTA go back with my Expeditionary paradigm; it has been with me since that New Year's Eve 2017. And while I once was a stone throw of that 200 lb floor, I now find myself...ready for a new adventure!

Look, I wish I had kept my past success instead of letting it slip through my fingers. I never developed a system that didn't a transitional element—it was always that blaze across the sky kind of an approach. I still want that kind of firepower, but I don't want that approaching 0 Icarus kind of flight.

As I wrote last, in these last 200 days of 2020, I want something special out of it. Sure, I want weightloss-turned-fitness goals to be met/exceeded et al and the Expeditionary system is just that; but, I want more, of course, but that's to be revealed further down the Gantt chart.

Come aboard...it's time to set sail!
