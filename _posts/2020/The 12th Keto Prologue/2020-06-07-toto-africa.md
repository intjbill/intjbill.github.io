I just came indoors from this year's first session of sun soaking. It was a quick ride around the block in the DeLorean. And like in recent years, I brought along my [🍹 Sun Soaking ☀ playlist](https://open.spotify.com/playlist/3erjIfN0OzGYmt9HiOUFXv?si=y-BM5c5gTRmFAYHVmWqZuA).

There's a certain simplicity about it, a disparate avenue away from systemic, virtual chrono-haggling that is so pervasive online. May I never spin the wheel that lands on the latest to foment a foaming torrent! Instead, forever I shall scroll across the landscape of my sphere of both context and reality. And right now, it involves a fitness countdown to the New Year. Eating right. Working out. Expanding my horizon.

And with a little luck, some sun.
