FINALLY. I have left all of the restarts of 2020 behind: I am on a diet that works. And it's from an unlikely approach for me, as a vegan/vegetarian dieter: I'm now fully on board with meat. While I can will myself on a nutrient dense diet that hovers around 1000, the early going satiety is just not there. And thing about a dietary transition is that it's gotta stick. It typically doesn't stay if I'm not satisfied. I made a fundamental shift after listening to the following audiobooks by Gary Taubes:

* *Why We Get Fat: And What to Do About It* (2010)
* *Good Calories, Bad Calories: Fats, Carbs, and the Controversial Science of Diet and Health* (2011)
* *The Case Against Sugar* (2016)

While adopting a low carb diet is nothing new, I never considered the perils of insulin resistance, specifically how carbs jack us up. Its omission just worked. I kind of stumbled down the scale, happily repeating the calories in – calories out mantra.

While still in development, my current diet adopts a greater ketogenic focus with a fat ratio of 70% of calories and a NET carbs at 5%. While I may include fiber down the road to this tally, I just don't see it as representative at this time. While, I hit the RDAs without supplements, I'm wavering as to if that will be a continued focus as I wonder how much RDA is required for a carb laden approach.

I gotta admit, my breakfast of 2 tbsp of butter with my cheesy omelet...it's a far ride away from what I've done.

Let's ride throughout the night into 2021!
