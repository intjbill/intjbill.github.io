...and tada!  I am now on GitHub Pages, though my audience may not know that until tomorrow once the DNS propagates across the Internet.  

Late last night, I wiped out my WordPress install for this move, but this morning I had second thoughts.  After doing the worn WP-CLI route and updating the configs, specifically regarding comments, I realized, "This is a bloaty hassle."

Therefore, I just tore it all down and...well, here I am.

There's a few tweaks I need to do.  I went with the Minimal-Mistakes theme just because I already had it customized to my CSS/HTML, though I'd like to find a DataTables solution that works...assuming I don't go ahead and run down what in the theme breaks the functionality.  Right now, I'm just going with a bland non-sortable markdown table.

I'd like to move on from site setup/design to a greater fitness orientation.  Once the site is established, updates will be easy.

I'd like to find use a clockdown clock solution for The 13th Expedition's weigh-in on July 30th.  I'm likely moving away from Last.fm integration.  It's such a ghost town anymore, reminiscent of a dusty player piano in a forgotten Old West saloon.
