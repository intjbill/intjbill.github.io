Despite my writing in the past of a potential to skip working out in The 13th Expedition, I'm planning to train this week.

I did weigh the merits of no workouts with a shift into The 14th Expedition into meditation and yoga. Those merits were driven by two things: 1) the novelty of weightloss without the 3-something mornings; 2) and this jaw thing going on—it's the whole physics of it. For example, when I hit the heavy bag, the heavy bag's hitting me reverberates through my body and slaps my jaw. That's not exactly the best methodology of a focused, joint relaxation regimen!

Nevertheless, even now as I listen to The 4th Expedition's playlist, I want to move and push out toward the horizon. And I'm shifting toward greater sensitivity of low impact workouts like more elliptical work.

The impetus of my workouts is to advance my physical and cognitive capacities. Whether 2018 or today, diet has always been the chief thrust for success. And as the calendar months fluttered off the wall, I just believe that my new diet is superior to my past 1000-1200 kcal diets.

...which is the point of this post, promoting those questions of our motivations and applying optimized approaches to achieving success all within an environment, that, let's face it, hits back.
