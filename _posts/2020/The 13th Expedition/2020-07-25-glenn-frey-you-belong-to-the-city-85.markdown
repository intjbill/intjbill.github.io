My recent adoption of gamification continues to pay off toward my fitness improvements and general approach to life. More importantly, it propels me to ask if a specific goal contributes to my vision. It's even opened up new possibilities.

It reminds me of a time back in 2001 as I was finishing up college and the employment search thereafter. I spent many hours with the companions of cup and coffee and a tablet of paper. Dreaming, thinking, planning and dreaming some more. I'd like to think I haven't lost that spirit, but admittedly, there are times when my vision gets out-of-focus. One year winds up looking a lot like the prior and so it goes as the years reel on.

Of course, it's hard to understand exactly what I want out of life, because that changes. Things that I targeted at 22 and 23 runs counter to my mind at 42 toward 43.

Yet, I remain the same person, even if my purpose has shifted. And even back then, I worked toward fitness, though I did not possess the today's tools and knowledge. That is the way of things.

In some ways, the world is so much smaller than it was then, now I've traveled a bit. Yet, it seems bigger as I don't feel tied down by the same paradigms that I once did.
