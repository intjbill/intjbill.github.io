I'm on the verge of returning to my 3AM-something workouts—I just *feel* it! Feelings are the driver to successful weightloss: I eat when I **feel** hunger and now, I **feel** I have energy for burning. It's hard to describe exactly; it's a....

* pep in my step,
* optimized footing,
* a leaner spirit,
* and just a general disposition of strength.

While I'm only entering my sixth day on this 70% fat calorie diet, I'm reaching a critical stage: my body **wants** to work out.

We don't work out to lose calories; we work out because we are losing calories. And yes, we don't eat too many calories and become fat; we eat too many calories because *we are fat*. I really wish I could have figured that out, but it's something I've learned from the afore-posted books by Gary Taubes.

Our fatness is seemingly merely a function of increased blood sugar and insulin resistance, the aftermath of the unsatisfying tease of the Crackhead Carb Cabaret. The other night, I cooked 3 pre-cut hamburger patties with 10 oz of cauliflower rice with 2 tbsp of butter, putting it at 67% fat and 5% carbs—a HUGE meal with plenty of satiety. At 729 calories, it was under the 778 calories as reported by the NCCDB of my past go-to burger at McDonald's, a Double Quarter Pounder with Cheese. The carb contrast was 5% to 21%. And with McD's, the show must go on so there's the large Coke and the large french fries. Still no satiety. Dance monkey dance! Generally, I followed up the McD's show with whatever snacks and ice cream I could gather throughout the night. And that's the basic dichotomy manufacturing American obesity.

This morning, I had a 3 egg omelet this morning with 1 oz of cheddar, 2 tbsps of butter, and a tbsp of coconut oil. I'll likely drop the butter down 1 tbsp because it was a little unwieldy to get the butter from the pan back into my omelet. Nothing new here, but...I did something I would have never thought I'd do:

* 12 oz of coffee
* 1 tbsp of butter
* 1 coconut oil

...all blended in a Vitamix. As Jules would say in *Pulp Fiction*, "Mm-hmm! This is a *tasty* (coffee)!"

Now, how will all of this stack with The 13<sup>th</sup> Expedition weigh-in in context my 1150 daily calorie Expedition kickoffs? Let's cruise into that sunset!
