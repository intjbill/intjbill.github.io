While I was very close to making my final move to GitHub, I never could get DataTables to work, which is weird, since I have no problems in doing so with a basic HTML file. After doing ALL sorts of Googling over the matter, I felt like outside of a random Reddit unresolved question from 3 years ago, I was the only person in the world to experience this.

So, I went back to the basics, and ran a brand-new instance of Jekyll. No problem. I did the same for the theme I'm using...bingo. Yeah, the inaptly-named minimal-mistakes has a glaring one! Now, I could spend time running down the exact issue, but as it is, I'm not exactly big on the author's breaking of front matter conventions, but C'MON, leaving DataTables off the table in a static page context?

What irks me is that I FINALLY had my design in place, very nearly replicating my WordPress install sans the dynamic elements, though I could very go with a JavaScript replacement for the countdown clock since computer clocks are far more accurate than they were back in the 90s.

I look forward to leaving all of this setup behind so that I can get back to thinking how I can optimize fitness.
