I draw closer to the weigh-in. I suspect my numbers would be better if I spent all six weeks in my new workout program as opposed to my 5th week kickoff. Of course, my justification for doing it for weightloss at the time was that I would be motivated to eat more thereby canceling out the energy expenditure. In practice, I've found that I haven't eaten more, though I have shifted to eating a portion of meat right after the session.

Yesterday, I noted that I've been torquing my knees with the bag workout. While I still want to focus on core strength, I shifted to a HIIT routine atop an exercise ball that has promise. For 15 sets, I spend 1 minute twisting and a brief hold to eliminate the snapback action as I rotate left to right. Following that, I then lean all the way back and come up in a situp to my knees for the next 30 seconds. Repeat. It was a nice stand-in for keeping my knees safe.

This morning, I'll likely do a variant of it while incorporating strikes. In the past, I've used it for situp strikes to the heavy bag: up: two forearm strikes; downward: two punches.

One of the more helpful tools I've been using is *Interval Timer* off of the F-Droid store. I'm sure there's a slew of interval apps on the Google play store, but I'm just not a fan of ads for something as basic as tracking time. While I've also been meditation (I'll write more about that in a later post), I like *Breathly* for breathing practice.
