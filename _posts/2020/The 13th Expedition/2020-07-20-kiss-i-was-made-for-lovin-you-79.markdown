Whew, I return to the comfortable confines of WordPress where I can happily tag my CSS excursions.

While my Jekyll/GitHub Pages experiment was a fun challenge, my results-to-development ratio was far too low! I honestly had no plans to learn JavaScript on the fly, yet, to get some basic functionality online or fix something that should just work, I had to pore over all sorts of Google results…and when you start seeing your own site pop up in Google about the issue you're having, you know there's some scant info out there.

So, I return to WordPress with all the easy extended functionality that it provides! I'm paying $3/month to host my stuff. I think it's worth it, especially as I just broke from ProtonMail which charged $5/month just to use a custom domain for email.

And NOW, I can focus on content generation and what I want to accomplish for the rest of the year including what I want to do with the Expeditions.

The 13th Expedition is not about workouts. At the outset, it has been a cruise into the rays of the night turned speedboat into the horizon. I know I made a declarative last week as to how I was developing a program—I still am, by the way—but, again, I am wooed by the novelty of having an entire Expedition based on no workouts (sans the first few days) in an unmonitored calorie context, while listening to my hunger. I recognize that workouts call for more resources. And yes, in the past, I had an ironfist will to maintain that 1000-1200 ceiling.

All that aside, my first workout will come on Thursday, July 30—I know, it sounds as though I'm trumpeting it more than I ought. It'll be the start of The 14th.
