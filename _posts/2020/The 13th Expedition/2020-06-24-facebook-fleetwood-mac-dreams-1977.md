I look forward to joining social media again. I know, my current ride into the night likely runs counter to actually running a website...

I swore everything off some time ago, all of those worn nouns of people, places, things, and ideas. Maybe it was the introvert in me or perhaps it was the full-blown INTJ thing going on. I just had to get away. I do not know if I can place my finger on the exact reason why, whether (1) my desire to run singularly in of itself; (2) the passing of ardent affections; or (3) the fear of species adaptation or groupthink—whatever you want to call it—that my absorption of the environment fundamentally changes me, i.e. since my exposure to social media would be among my inputs, what would be my output? It might be as benign as declaring, "I love Cuke; it's heaven in a can." Or, it might be something more insidious. Could it be that our world is evolving into a cyberpunk future? Are we installing the conduit for *A New Hope* Death Star dystopia that shapes individuals to an Orwellian virtual-to-reality gradient of a Cold War East Berlin where we slam back another cup of the bitter sludge of nihilism in the coffeehouse at the corner of Existential Dread and Uncertainty...

...I don't know...

...it may be true, but that's far too many characters to post on Twitter and it's REALLY not the kind of content that can bear the gravitas of a Like approval on Facebook.

Nevertheless, I'd like to cruise across the virtual space of friends...

    Now, here you go again.<br />You say you want your freedom,<br />Well, who am I to keep you down?<br />It's only right that you should<br />Play the way you feel it.<br />But, listen carefully to the sound<br />Of your loneliness—<br />Like a heartbeat...drives you mad.<br />In the stillness of remembering what you had<br />And what you lost...

Deep into the night, we go in our neon blaze...
