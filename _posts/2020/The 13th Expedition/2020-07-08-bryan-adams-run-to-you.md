Of all my successful Expeditions, I'm going to like the results of this one. The 13th Expedition has been by far the least active, so much so that it makes me wonder if weightloss is more of a function of doing things we like to do. C'mon, how herculean it is to push through as a vegan with another bag of spinach? Whereas yesterday, I had:

  * 4 tbsp of coconut oil
  * 3 tbsp of butter
  * 10 oz of pork shoulder
  * 3 eggs
  * 3 oz of cheddar cheese
  * a cup of bone broth from pork neck
  * 1.3 oz of raw sunflower seeds
  * 2 tbsp of ground flaxseed
  * 2 oz of spinach
  * 24 oz of coffee
  * 2 tbsp of cacao powder

I have NO idea how many calories that is and don't care. It does hit or get close to my goals:

  * Fat (190): 190.6 g
  * Protein (140): 139.4 g
  * Carbs (30): 28.7 g

OK, OK, so I also had 1.6 oz of pork rinds from a barbecue shack, but, C'MON, it was the last night of being 41!

My diet throughout The 13th Expedition has been some sort remix of the above; when I went with chicken instead of pork, I'd add butter for more fat; and lower and raise sunflower amounts to hit nutritional needs. I just keep working the levers on Cronometer.

With the exception of a few days, I haven't had my 3AM something workouts with the exception of an occasional series of sun salutations and warrior poses. There hasn't been the 2 1/2 hour morning grind with a follow-up lunch or dinner cardio. Whereas exercise is awesome as it adds to mind, body, and ability, I no longer see it as the driver of weightloss success. However, as a proponent of fitness—well, OBVIOUSLY...

And as this whole Expeditionary is all about approaching optimized fitness—well, OBVIOUSLY...

What's amazing to me is that a meal plan that I list above not only works, but works effectively well. I can point my indomitable spirit not at my plate, but direct it toward greater dividends.
