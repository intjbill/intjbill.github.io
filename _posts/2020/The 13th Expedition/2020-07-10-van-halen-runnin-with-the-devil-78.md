As I'm hobbling around the house in a foot brace, it's looking like my decision to train minimally in The 13th Expedition was a fortuitous decision. Not that I necessarily chose it as part of my strategy; I just never could figure out how to maximize my time at 3-something in the morning with 7 hours of sleep since I have yet to insert the punch cards for an early work shift change of consciousness.

But hey, my current predicament has no bearing on my weightloss approach. Win?

I have NO idea what's wrong with my foot. In the past, a foot injury always had to do something with rolling my foot. This time, it was just the sudden sharp pain at the bottom of my foot, stopping me in my tracks. I owe my mobility in recent days to this brace velcro-ing everything in place.

Foot pain is nothing new in this Expeditionary approach. I'm pretty sure I picked up a stress fracture at the outset of last year, in January 2019, which explains the May '19 restart.

I do want my training regimen to return to The Expeditions for greater fitness, but not for weightloss. It's not that I've been wholly separated from it: if I need to get rid of excess energy, I'll hit the iron or slap the heavy bag around. But, that's a far cry from the 3-something to 6 AM sessions. Admittedly, I'm tempted to hold back from training during The 13th just as a point of comparison to all my effort in the past. Still, like everything else, it's about being mindful of my status; when I'm compelled to hit the treadmill, there I shall be.
