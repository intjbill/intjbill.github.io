We're two weeks out into The 13th Expedition. My takeaways thus far:

  1. While I have to weigh myself, I feel lighter and look forward to the weigh-in at the end of the month;
  2. While I feel the need to work out before first light, I want to optimize sleep, leaving the dilemma unanswered.

The sustainability of a high fat diet looks promising, but, I've got 16 weeks to go in comparing it to my most successful string of Expeditions in 2019 that kicked off just a pound more than The 13th Expedition:

  * **The Lost 7th Expedition**: 43 lbs
  * **The 8th Expedition**: 24 lbs
  * **The 9th Expedition**: 14.75 lbs.

What I *really* want to know is what will happen *after* 3 Expeditions? I quit in 2019 and the [graph on Fit](https://www.intjbill.com/fit/) shows the rocket ride across the scale. Furthermore, I'm curious as to how I'll move to a non-tracking diet once I enter my goal range. Clearly, it'll involve choices with zero-to-minimum amount of carbs and when I drink my french press coffee blended with butter and coconut oil, that's a choice I'll toast. Of course, all of this is discussion for 2021.

I'm going to go ahead and call it: a high fat diet will be my approach for 2020 and beyond. Consider the approach: I'm losing weight with it, I ignore calories, and I'm safe with 0 threats of binges. That's the recipe of daily compounding of fitness success. While not perfect, I've scheduled today's intake:

  * **Fat**: 197 grams (190 goal)
  * **Protein**: 127 grams (140 goal)
  * **Total Carbs**: 29.5 (30 limit)

As I now have my diet in place to achieve weightloss, I will not post further on the subject—*HUZZAH*, because it's a bit of a drag to discuss. And C'MON—this ain't a health nut blog!
