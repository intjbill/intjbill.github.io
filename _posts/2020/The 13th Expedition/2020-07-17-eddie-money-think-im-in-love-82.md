In following up with yesterday's post, I've found success with a Jekyll/Github combo for web hosting; I now have a better handle on the GitHub Desktop. It was really just a matter of setup: instead of treating it like a FTP client, I should have considered it in terms of a syncing client like WebDAV or something similar. I re-created my repository from GitHub, pulled it down to make changes, and then GitHub Desktop uploaded only those files I altered. And when I made changes to the files via the site, the client informed me of its need to sync. Pretty cool.

I'm leaning toward adopting Github Pages for this website. As referenced yesterday, I'm working with a new theme and while there's some pretty cool features to it, it's a little bit of a hassle to form it into a something resembling my WordPress install. I don't plan to emulate it, but I do want the same overall feel. I've banged my head a little with it, so much I'm considering to just develop my own theme outright—still, I'd prefer just to adopt someone else's code and splatter some CSS in its direction.

In the move, I'll most likely get rid of a couple of features: currently playing and my countdown clock, two plugins that are no longer maintained by their authors, making them security risks, though I have some faith in my WP-CLI approach to maintenance. Honestly, I'd like to move to static so that I can giggle at my daily Cylon visits from China, Russia, Amazon AWS and more!

In replacing TablePress, I'm considering on adapting DataTables to talk with Google Sheets. It beats maintaining a static table—that's for SURE—and will hopefully resolve the problem I'm having with Google Charts rendering two tables on the same page. I can get multiple charts to render, but perhaps there's some sort of syntax I gotta run down.

And honestly, if I can get way from those darn "smart" single and double quotes that my WordPress install renders by default, my world will rock! OK, so I'm sure I could fix that, but, I honestly just don't want to fool with something I don't otherwise notice if I wasn't maintaining two sites at the same time with identical content.

Ugh, these have been the bane of my life since I was learning to drive:

* 1993: Microsoft released smart quotes
* 1994: Microsoft released Comic Sans

Who hated humanity on that design team? Might be [this guy](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uM61HIqLBeI).
