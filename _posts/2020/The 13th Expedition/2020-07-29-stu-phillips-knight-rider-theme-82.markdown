The 13th Expedition is winding down. In less than 24 hours, I'll be moving on to The 14th Expedition in this daily march to 2021.

There have been some good things that have come out of these last 41 days. Immediately, I think of the year-long subscriptions to the following:

* [Cronometer.com](https://www.cronometer.com)
* Brooklyn Public Library
* [Habitica.com](https://www.habitica.com)

Still further from The 13th Expedition:

* Maintained a new 70%+ fat approach with 5% total carbs
* Adopted new items like butter & coconut oil coffee and bone broth.
* Averaged an audiobook a day.
* Added a solid meditation/visualization regimen.
* Migrated over to GitHub Pages for this site's web host.

Of course, there's the return to hitting my FitBit step goals and my 3 AM-something workouts. There's even an Expeditionary playlist coming together based on a theme reminiscent of past Expeditions.

Regardless of the outcome on Thursday, The 13th Expedition is my best Expedition from an innovation perspective.

Befittingly, as this is the 42nd day of The 13th Expedition, exactly eight years ago today, I was returning with my boon out of Heathrow through all the Olympic fanfare and regalia.
