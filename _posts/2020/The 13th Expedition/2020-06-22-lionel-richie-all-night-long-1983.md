There's an an overarching characteristic of my diet approach that I find particularly compelling in the context of future success: a freedom with a mitigation of factors that make *that* chihuahua drive the Carb Crackhead Express in its nightly run to the border!

Look, I totally get the carb cravings where the satiety signals skipped work that day to go to the zoo, a place where the marketing dogma of Lay's "Bet you can't eat just one" extends beyond a potato chip to tacos, doughnuts, pizza slices et al—a converyor belt of wheat and sugar Armageddon amalgamations! I'm convinced that even without winding up [Cronometer](https://cronometer.com/) to track Total Carb grams, that if I followed a diet that had no wheat or refined sugars, I'd lose weight.

Of course, I'm not doing just that, rather I've basically replaced my carb intake with fat intake with the heralded 70% / 25% / 5% of daily calories approach. For example: this morning's breakfast of an omelet with a cup of coffee at 81% / 17% / 2%:

  * 4 eggs (likely will drop this down an egg tomorrow)
  * 1 tbsp of butter
  * 2 tbsp of coconut oil
  * 1 oz of cheddar cheese

The thing about a high fat diet is where I once kept my daily calories around 1150 for 116 days straight, I now don't mind them...and we'll see in 38 days to see how the results compare to my 1st, 4th, 7th, and 11th Expeditions. It's all about the satiety and its practical application beyond the pale of my workshop. A mindset of cutting weight before a match just doesn't cut it for me...and I've got 2018 to spring 2000 to show for it.

And it's not about Total Carb exclusion; it's more of a strategic carb approach. For example, I want those lovely omega 3's from flaxseed and I'm looking to add a second tbsp of cacao powder into my diet. Ironically, adding carbs back into my diet is where the freedom is compromised.
