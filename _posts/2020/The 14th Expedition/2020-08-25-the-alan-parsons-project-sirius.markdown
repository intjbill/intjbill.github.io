I am at a crossroads with this site, as I reconsider its role in my life.  I feel as though I should de-prioritize its position as a daily memoir of sorts, as incomplete of a function as I've wielded it.  It's like the paradigm of a chef:  I invest my opening moments to whip up something for consumption only for my dish to be soon forgotten. I do prefer creating pages over posts due to their permanence as I'd rather be a woodworker in my content creation.

And while I like the self-motivational aspects of daily posts and their penchant to create new ideas, I'd rather establish a few, core ideas and spend my time refining those.  

I tend to dabble intellectually.  I've long lost the belief that I can know it all; however, I do like picking up a pinch of this and a pound of that.  I'm blessed that English is the lingua franca of the world and to come to age in parallel with the Internet.  Still, would I have honed a sharper blade if there wasn't this great expanse before me?

I don't need to dabble.  It's funny how dabbling to me used to pair nicely with my news consumption; now that I actively ignore medias, my dabbling foundation cracks.  There's gotta be a correlation to that!

Still, there's a place for those *potent potables* in my life—I just don't need to consume them to excess!  I guess the vogue application is Pareto here—well, in so far as time's role goes...and what do I know, maybe the new team role player would possess a bountiful effect as well!

...which brings me back to this site.  There are some core, structural pillars I want to promote in my life, thereby I promote them on my site, yet, there should be a little wiggle room for the malleable.  Or the mandible for that matter!
