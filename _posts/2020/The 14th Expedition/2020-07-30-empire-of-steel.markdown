And without further adieu, the results of The 13th Expedition are in!

I lost 24.25 lbs!  


I achieved this by the daily average of the following:

* Fat: 196.2 g
* Protein: 151.5 g
* Carbs: 30.5 g
* Kcal: 2297.6

The numbers are a little elevated, because I didn't finish developing my approach at the outset as my intent was a 190/140/30 approach.

It's the opening salvo of a long struggle, but, I feel confident.

And thus, as you might have expected, the playlist:
