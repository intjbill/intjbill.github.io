With an obvious timing during today's meditation, it occurred to me that there is value packed in the action of letting go.  I am not referencing the practice of mindfulness, but, applying it to our lives beyond that mindspace.  

How often do we get rankled by the things that have little bearing on our own lives?  When I followed sports—Go Sports!—I'd get brought to a boil by its emotional stove.  Sure, I wasn't *playing*, but, the emotions I experienced paralleled to participation, even from my spot in the bleachers from my TV.  Clearly, it's fun being at the game itself as the home crowd atmosphere sweeps us up into its emotion-as-one wave; there's nothing quite like a breakaway run in that charged atmosphere!

But, from my couch?  Why do I engage the fight-or-flight response and get so dinged up over something that has no bearing to my surroundings?

Further thought:  this has potential of widescale adoption beyond the scope of *foosball*.

There's other areas of my life as well, things that while are under my purview, are things that I place more significance in them than they deserve.  There's value in taking a step back and then letting that pesky thing be pushed along by the wind to the forgotten memories of the ocean.

For far too often, my fist shook vigorously, latched onto something that I should have just slowly breathed out away from my Technicolor world as it floats and fades into a monochrome landscape.

I'm learning a new approach to my workouts, leaving behind the all-or-nothing dogma of years past, a high-stress application that shortens lives.  Rather, I simply listen to my body.  When it is ready, I go.  When it is complete, I stop.  Clearly, for many, this is not the methodology where I suspect short-sighted turbulence can achieve short-term goals.  But as for me...

...I swim along the chrono currents.
