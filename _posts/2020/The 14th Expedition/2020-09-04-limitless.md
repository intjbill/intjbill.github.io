There's a consistency that I seek for my life.  I've felt as though I jumped into an infinite amount of points simultaneously.  Whether email providers, Internet browsers, web hosts, music platforms, task management, book genres, or how I choose to portray my life, I feel a multiplicity of me.  It's like that scene in *Limited* where the protagonist is all over the place, as he cleans his apartment:

Momentarily, the rapidity of this development concerned me—I even took a break from the cascade of my reading schedule. I came back with the realization that perhaps I am experiencing the ketogenic clarity I've read about along with my daily doses of cacao, max speed audiobooks, EPA/DHA fat pills etc are affecting this INTJ's cognition?

All of my activity is about examining the *best* way for me, putting aside the theoretical aside and distinguishing the very real pragmatic application—not what *might* happen...of course, the day-to-day does shape and bend our horizon, so I'm not totally without a long-term mindset.  But, that is more an intrinsic personal evolution than countering *what if* scenarios.

Instead of being lost in the swirling winds of information as the cold front slithers and encircles, I stand in the storm and emerge as Thundercast.
