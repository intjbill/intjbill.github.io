After some flirting with a return to WordPress self-hosting, I'm back on GitHub.  There are some design elements and extended functionality that I love having with a WordPress install that isn't available on a static site.  But, even from a cache perspective, it's hard to beat the speed and security that GitHub provides.  And while I pay something around a nickel a day to host my site,  I still save a nickel by staying on GitHub.  

It's been one of those moments where I spend more time on weighing decisions as opposed to the production itself;  I find that irritating.

Eventually, I make the decision and go with GH.  Not that the other path is *bad*—it's even a good path.

As in my web host, so too, have I considered Google.  After listening to half of Gilder's *Life After Google: The Fall of Big Data and the Rise of the Blockchain Economy*, I opted to leave Google behind.  It's a values judgement.  I firmly believe that humans are NOT just the evolutionary step toward AI—we're far more than algorithmic wetware for we were made in the image of God.  

...then there's everything I've written before about Google...thus, I uninstalled Chrome and ran a factory reset on my phone and installed Aurora Store for my apps. I signed up for an account with ProtonMail and updated my other accounts accordingly.  

My next step is a curious one: I'm just not letting anyone know my updated address.  It's not like I had rousing volley of interactions that would be difficult to leave behind—most everyone I once knew can no longer grasp me...and those that could, were silent.  I just don't think anyone *cares*.   My Inbox is a solitary place.

> I cannot feel your hand

It's not that I'm going to leave everybody behind forever.  I'm considering a future return to social media—* *sigh* * how that fails to feel!  Those who once felt *so alive* have been framed by a display and reduced to X Y coordinates.
