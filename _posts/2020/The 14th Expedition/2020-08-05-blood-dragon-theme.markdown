I've got another tool that may contribute to my success, if not immediately now, I'm considering it as an investment toward future activity and a declaration:  I now have bone conduction headphones!  It's something I read out of *Runner's World*, and I gotta admit, it's pretty cool tech!  Regarding quality, it won't be giving my M50x cans a run for its money anytime soon in most scenarios, but, Aftershokz Trekz Titatnium is an immediate starter for this weekend's session with John Deere.  The other night on the treadmill, I had ear plugs in my ears while wearing them and the sound is actually *better* !  

With its purchase, I'm pointing toward *Future Me* , that guy running in the city, gliding across a park.

While I have yet to read specifically on the subject—there have been a few passages in the keto books I've been tearing through—I may be adding more sleep to my schedule.  Lately, I've been grabbing a keto coffee as I prepare my day before my workout; it's not something I did before in that 3AM solace.  I could move that to a post-workout activity and sleep in to 4 instead.
