Sunday was a cooldown day for me from physical activity.  I continue to explore applications where to move slow, I go fast; it's not so much the *tortoise vs the hare* negligence scenario, but, it's more akin to how maintaining a high level is not sustainable and leads to poor results whether from body response or burnout.

I didn't drop everything:  I maintained my meditation practice, finished another audiobook, and had all sorts of data entry into Goodreads with the intent of saving future time.  Admittedly, converting 2 tables to markdown and re-uploading everyday had been building into a tedious exercise.  Goodreads doesn't exactly lend itself to bulk entry with finished reading dates.  I went so far as to change each title from its default hardcover to audiobook entry.  And while I would prefer the accuracy, the cover art style is ugly.  So, I shouldered the work in reverse to fix 30 books.  But at the time of this riding, I've got 98 read entries and another 26 queued up.

This week, I'll be applying the Pareto principle, an approach I was reminded after reading Fitzgerald's *80/20 Running: Run Stronger and Race Faster by Training Slower.*  Basically, I'm looking to approach low-intensity training on most days, reserving one day when I push the pedal towards the floor.

On the nutrition front, I'm considering in trading out my multivitamin for increased spinach and broccoli, though admittedly, I bristle at going beyond my 30 total carb target...and I GOTTA have my cacao!
