I have returned to Google. It wasn't supposed to be this way, of course.  I went on-and-on in multiple posts out the *ickiness* of Google—OK, maybe two posts.  I deleted Google and moved on to ProtonMail and I was fine with it...

Until LibreOffice.

OK, it was *more* than just LibreOffice.  

I've written before how I enjoy FocusWriter with a white text on black schema.  Additionally, my website basically  follows the same schema.  There are additional tools out there, whether Sublime Text or the Intellij IDE, where they provide a dark mode option.  And as I've found that Windows 10 provides it as well, I'm aboard.

But, who isn't on board?  The developers of LibreOffice.  They *love* to blow up my eyeballs!  Seriously, I ran down the log thread of its discussion of implementation requests and it's just not something they want to do...which doesn't surprise me coming from an application that doesn't provide an autosave. The last time checked, it wasn't 2003.

So, I scrambled for a replacement of LibreCalc.  And guess what I realized...

...and I'm back on Google!

And with my return, I finally looked at YouTube Music, the upcoming replacement of Google Play Music.  To be fair, I always thought that was an awkward name for a music service and I never could wrap my mind around why they ran *two* music services.  Nevertheless, I moved my uploaded music from the outgoing service to the new one.  I don't have a lot there, but, it's basically stuff that other services don't have, the soundtracks to all four *Battlestar Galactica* seasons and 8 albums of Garth Brooks.

How do I feel about returning to Google?  Resigned, I suppose.  Look, it's bigger than anything I can do about it, right?  The tools are outstanding....and yet...the price of admission is submission.  Frankly, we cannot practically exist online and dodge Google.  We'd have to *completely* unplug.  And in the right context, with a mojito in hand on that fabled Pacific island beach with Rex, my banana-fueled chimpanzee manservant, I might be able to pull such a life off.  But, for now...
