Day 1 of 2021 wasn't just a fluke!  This morning matches the same schema:  4AMish - 5AM-ish with Python, followed by a 100-120 minute workout while listening to an audiobook.  I'm now on my 3rd book this year.

Unlike the life of Days Past, I approach each day very purposeful via calendar and task management platforms, all within the box of my thematic, three-pronged approach, like if Batman stole Aquaman's pointy stick!  Sure, there are things outside of the box, but that's beyond the scope of how I *Restore, Retrofit and Retrowave: Outrun the Night.*

In some respects, it's a little weird to be writing from this vantage point, that is, the place where I didn't wind up on Facebook.  I *did* look forward to the return, of course and *will be back on New Year's Eve 2021*; I only deactivated my account.  For now, the greater advantage remains in the wilderness, driving through the neon nightscape.
