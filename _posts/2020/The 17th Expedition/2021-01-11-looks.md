I crushed it in today's workout.  I even added an additional rep into my MaxiClimber closeout to MWF workouts, establishing a 3 x 3min MaxiClimber with 1min rests.  I even had enough in my tank to know I could do a 4th.  I still remember not too long ago when I was dying at just a minute in.

Call me Mystic Mac, but this *looks* like 2021 for me:

...and thanks to the Reface app, this video actually *looks* like me!  I have no plans to go down to Conor's dehydrated 145 lb weigh-in, but with a target of 163, I'll be in the neighborhood.

I'm now into Day 50 on my carnivore diet and finishing up my first three weeks of The Yeard, my attempt to grow a beard without any trimming.
