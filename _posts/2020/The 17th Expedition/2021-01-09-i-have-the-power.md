I'm closing in on 7 weeks on a carnivore diet.  This morning, I thought I'd take a picture of what I generally eat everyday: 2.5 oz of post-cooked bacon coupled with 1 pre-cooked lb of ground beef with 2 tbsps of bacon fat on top.  I eat that 4 hours after waking up and eat another lb of beef 4 hour after my first meal.

I really do have to credit [Kelly Hogan's myzerocarblife](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCaKl8Lth6h6GWreFyeO1keA) for this diet.  It's been simple and so...well, I just need to stand outside Castle Grayskull real quick to show you!

On [my Resolutions page](/resolutions/), I've been linking to a Google sheet that records my workout sessions.  It's all still in progress, of course, but I like to plan ahead what I'm exactly going to do and what actually happens.  It's both motivational and helpful in tracking progress.  While a resistance routine cuts an easy path, I wasn't sure where I wanted to take my endurance regimen.  I mean, it's easy to do what I've done, an hour on the treadmill here, another on the elliptical there.  But, 2021 is a different space: I'm training to run in seven 5Ks.

Up 'til now, my focus has been to lose weight and then worry about a program when I got there.  Well, I'm basically there now, not  the sub-200, but...well, please refer to the above with my Battle Cat.

So, I'm going with a Couch-to-5K program to ramp my progress up, something [very similar to this example](http://www.c25k.com/c25k_treadmill.html).  In fact, I did session #1 this morning.  It wasn't difficult to do with my phone holding onto the stopwatch as I'm used to double+ of the amount of sets at 3 times longer through my heavy bag routine.  

The challenge is for my lower body to get up to speed and to find a breathing approach that I like the best.  I've been trying out a 2-2 approach, that is, breathe in for 2 steps and release for 2 steps.  I'm also trying out a 2-3.
