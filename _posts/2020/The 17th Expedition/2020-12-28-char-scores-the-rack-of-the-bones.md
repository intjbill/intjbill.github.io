While I have yet to formulate a new training regimen as I squeeze the last dregs out of 2020, I put in an hour of cardio followed by a brief striking session that was nowhere near my standards of an hour-long circuit.

But, there's time to get everything setup before January 1st's 3:45 AM kickoff. That said, this New Year's Eve, I think I'm going to celebrate for the European continent when 5 PM hits for the Central Time Zone. I gotta get up early to kickoff the build!

In 2021, I will be researching, experimenting, and constructing The Greatest Me. It won't be just another forgotten year—alas how many of those I've have! While there will be new elements, I'm plugging retro cards into the motherboard's ISA slots.

As I write this, I listen to the Smashing Pumpkins' Mayonnaise. Its live performance is one of my all-time favorite YouTube videos:
