Admittedly, I'm coming off a bit retro here in 2021.  For a moment yesterday, I realized I was ripping CDs while reinforcing my coding skills—it could have *easily* been 1999 as I was converting Weezer's blue album, The Smashing Pumpkins's *Adore* and Shania Twain's *The Woman in Me* to a digital format.

Honestly, when was the last time I scribbled out a flow chart to consider a programming problem?  Man, I ought to go hop in my Mustang convertible, light my cigar and head out into the night with some Springsteen!

Oh, those days are so *long ago*, aren't they?!  But, nevertheless, here I am exploring conditional statements again in all their old,  if / then / else glory.

And if I may borrow from [my high school analogy](/let-go/), I guess, too, I was reminded with that brief couple of days considering if I ought to find a table to sit at in the lunchroom... *(who knew there was ever an option to put the tray down and just leave?)*

...I want to be back on Facebook, I do.  I miss people, especially as I now listen to R.E.M's 1992 *Automatic for the People*.  

Why don't I? 

*sigh* 

It's hard to put into words...it's not even because I'm still working on my fitness and really want that *choice* return when I'm rockin' it... *(OK, so I like the idea of that!)* ...it's NOT the driver.  

Maybe I'm afraid of the hurt.  

It's hard to admit that, of course, I'm an INTJ Superman, right?  Emotions don't bother me!  Ah, but the misunderstood INTJ sits at this keyboard; he hangs out in a Batcave, not a telephone booth.
