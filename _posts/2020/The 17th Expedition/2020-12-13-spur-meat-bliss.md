Yesterday was another beautiful, sunny day, pulled right out of spring.  I grabbed a claw hammer, pulled out saw horses, and lifted a deck plank atop them.

And while my labor would provide me a bounty of great boards, these riches also had planks that had undergone rot and the sheer stress of my crowbar.
