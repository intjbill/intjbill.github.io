> We're now ten days into the new year.  While I didn't specifically spell this out, this move follows in the same direction I move:  I've dropped my monthly fees for the UFC to pick up a subscription to the *New York Times*.  It also is significant as a break from my 2020 position of ignoring all social and news medias.  There is a large gap of what happened in 2020 that is blank to me and from what I heard, I'm better for it.  However, I reconnected on election day and reaped what was sown.

> I *love* watching MMA, of course, but I don't think another guillotine or arm bar is going to advance my knowledge on the subject as a spectator.  Still, I cannot think of another option that inspires a mindless workout on my end.

...which is what I wrote for this blog post.  I posted it and ran with it.  But, as I read the news stories, I just didn't feel like *me*.  And honestly, reading it just felt like I pulled clothes out of a pool and put them on.  While I like the writing and its depth, the lack of relevancy and brooding mood was just a turn off.  Fortunately, I signed up with PayPal so the cancellation will be easy, as their bot couldn't help me to cancel and apparently no one works there right now.  

I very well may return to my UFC viewership.  It inspires and brings joy.  

Of course, sometimes you gotta go slow to move fast.  While I had a MWF strength schedule with a TRSS endurance schedule, I'm pulling Sunday out of the lineup as a day of rest.  Sure, I could have worked out, even my alarm woke me up at 3-something, but one day of relative rest might provide better gains.  

In practice, I spent a bit of time on a ladder this morning cutting off power to electrical ballasts and installing direct power to new tube lights.  [Toggled](https://toggled.com/) makes a pretty cool product.  I wish I knew about it before replacing the other 20 tubes in my gym.
