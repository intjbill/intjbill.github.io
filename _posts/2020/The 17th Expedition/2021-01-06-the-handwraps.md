I am stoked:  I love my new handwraps, [Sanabul's *PAW v.2 Gel Cross Training Handwrap Gloves*](https://sanabulsports.com/collections/bags-accessories/products/new-item-sanabul-paw-v-2-gel-boxing-mma-kickboxing-cross-training-handwrap-gloves).  Despite wearing 16 oz gloves, my knuckles have taken a beating in these opening days of 2021, despite my new MWF schedule.  Wearing these handwraps underneath my gloves ought to shore up that problem AND they'll go well with my dumbbell work as well!

While I developed a good dumbbell routine back in 2018, I moved away from it in 2019 as I focused on cardio.  I think I was just burned out doing it M-F.  I like using dumbbells: I have an iron hex set with pairs from 5 lb with 5lb increments up to 40 lb with an accompanying db rack.  Anything more and I would have to give gym membership another go.

I had to suspend my exercise routine for my triceps as something is popping there from the time I tore down the deck while I was awkwardly pulling when the object suddenly stopped and while never releasing my grasp, I kept going.

However, I added another set to my Maxiclimber, making it 2 x 3 minutes something in which I'd like to continue to develop.
