So IGNORE what I wrote in my last post: I'm BACK on WordPress and have cut out past before 2020's move into keto toward carnivore.

There's really not a strong reason for that dividing line; it's just that I'm not missing any content since that restart in June since not having anything from 2019 leaves a weird hole in The Expeditions. As far as everything before then, 2002 – 2004 and my poetry from 1997 to 2011, well, I just felt too vulnerable and/or things were difficult to read with 20/20 hindsight. As this is my fun isle retreat, there's no need for it.

And while I'm leaving the free harbor of GitHub, as I shared yesterday, my hosting is cheap since like most of the web, this is my island, one that is far away from the major shipping routes of the great wide web.

As I write, I don't expect anyone to immediately read this as I've got my harbor closed—I'm adding a few design tweaks to this site design AND I'm copying/pasting content from the past couple of months from text file to WordPress.

It's a good time to optimize a few things as 2021 is coming upon us.
