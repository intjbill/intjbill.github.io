As I write this blog, I am in the middle of a wireless nic issue for an old, 233 Mhz Dell notebook that is running Win98. I'm in my second day of working on it and despite of the counsel I have received from others, it continues to remain resolved. Though who knows, perhaps as I type this, the issue is being resolved.

I like the concept of wireless networking, and it will be an environment that I will be in at my new place, but the setup that we currently have at U of M sure provices its share of headaches for a Win98 client– and I'm not even a user! Though seemingly, even with the knowledge/experience I still wind up at the same place, just faster.

As it is, maintaining Orinoco as a standard apparently prohibits other wireless nics from being involved which seems like a foolhardy decision on someone's part. But alas... the world we live in is not the world of Bill... argh, my last rendition of getting this to work just failed... bah! There goes enough half hour of my life lost without anything of value becoming of it.

More later.
