Just a brief update here: tonight marks the last night that I'll have broadband access here in Midtown– assuming Time Warner doesn't try to shoot down my plans. This is the kind of thing that big, corporate conglomerates seemingly love to frustrate my planning. I have decided that I no longer require broadband access and in efforts to cut back spending, I will have free dialup access from work if need be. It should also free up additional time. Upon a line of tangency, tomorrow I will be canceling my garage access at work.

By the way, I have developed a new style of urban art. Next time you have a lighter along with a couple of credit cards, give it a whirl in combination with running water.
