Back to back days for blog entries: what does this all mean? I have noticed that I will engage in whatever activity that is of my interest in spurts, whether journaling my thoughts or journaling my workouts. Though it is inherent in my nature to jump from one area of interest to another, quickly assessing what values from it I can apply to my own life, there are some pursuits in which should not be sporadically engaged.

I have not trained my body vigorously since the summer of 2001– nearly two years! I taped up my knee and headed towards the gym on campus after work. I rode a stationary bike for 1 hour, with the first half keeping my heart rate at 170 and the second half pushing the pace to keep it around 185 – 190. Afterward, I joined some of our CSS student workers for a little ball action, at one point 3 on 3. It proved to be an arduous task without the strength of my right leg for running, quick movements, or jumping and my thumb brace altered my shot. My stamina itself was low.

It is a journey I am upon to reach the peaks of my past performance and beyond. Unlike days bygone, I am not setting my goals by a particular date for one will only find failure in the end. I am approaching this as a lifestyle of continuous improvement even to the point when constant tweaking with be necessary. For now, there is so much work that needs to be done that the sky is the limit. Currently, I will be concentrating on my lower body and stamina.
