What thoughts do I have to share in today's edition? It's hard to top yesterday's blog for it is a brief overview of the culmination and implementation of several months of planning. So if you have not read May 1st , don't waste your time reading this date any further because it is garbage!

As I write this, I am listening to David Helpling's Between Green and Blue album. The track in particular is "Plateau" and it provides a smooth ambience. I enjoy the non-vocal new-age genre. Oh, what the heck, you're my prized audience, allow me to share a secret to my upcoming plans for apartment decor: piping similar music on a near 24-7 basis. One just might hypothesize that I spent too much time working at the now-defunct World of Science! I have brainstormed several ideas I would like to implement in the new living space, though much of the character depends on its availability at a reasonable price with respect to the funds available. I shall dive into the depths of my imagination and approach the solution in manners which are not typically considered. It should hold the ambience of a soothing environment while acting as a catalyst toward adventures within the deep recesses of one's cognizance. I hope to emphasize the olfactory, auditory, and visual experiences. One might say that I am just not one who seemingly uses pizza delivery boxes for ornamentation. Of course, all of these ideas and theories mean nothing if I do not find appropriate methodologies to bring them to reality.

To certain extent, I should apply the old adage of "don't count your chickens before they are hatched" for the apartment management group is in the process of running a credit check on me. Granted, there's a large success rate that I will be approved, but one should keep in mind possible setbacks in order to handle future events more effectively.
