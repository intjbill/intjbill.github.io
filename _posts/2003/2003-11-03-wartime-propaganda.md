When it comes to updating my website, I seem to always have two options before me with which I wrestle:

1) Just post another blog and consider fixing the spelling error on the front page

2) Rework the entire site and add some REALLY GREAT tools and resources!

Most of the time, I toss all of this out as a false dilemma and do neither. Do I have an new rendition in mind? Sure I do! Will I ever get around to working on it? Ehh....

Yes, I have been removing distractions out of my life. I'm remaining single for the time being and given away that hideous box known as the TV.

"Must See TV" of "reality shows": Is our life composed of watching others living their lives? Live life, be free!

Why do I want to watch a depraved lifestyle, all the while the world subtly suggests that this is the way one should live? The utterly sad part is that people DO watch it! You dullards– at least go out and SIN– don't just sit on the sidelines! Since as a non-Christian, you're eternally damned anyway, GO, enjoy the pleasures of the world. Don't just sit back and passively watch it! Take the road to Hell in a blaze of glory! Life is not that of fence sitters. You're on either one side or the other.

Television is a tool. There are lessons that can be gained in the media we have to choose. Unfortunately, tools such as a television, are used by our culture to dump information into our consciousness that has little merit, other than holding us in storage to pass time, drawing us closer to our deaths with the backdrop of the prerecorded laughter of sitcoms. We blankly stare into the systematic flickering all the while worldly propaganda is given a direct path into our minds: "You're not _______ enough, buy THIS and you will be _______!"

What a better way for one to not realize what truly is evident then to be told that it is does not exist and then remove this dissident from his office of critical thinking to a shiny-packaged, gregarious, storage unit.

> I believe it is our fate to be here. It is our destiny. I believe this night holds, for each and every one of us, the very meaning of our lives. This is a war and we are soldiers. What if tomorrow the war could be over? Isn't that worth fighting for? Isn't that worth dying for?

We go through seasons of our lives in which we hunger after knowledge and ravenously pursue truth so that we may absorb its succulent savor. I am upon this quiet road, a path that winds its way by the merriment of meadows and the foreboding of forests. I recognize that life does not entail that which is expressed as "reality".

The war we are within is not waged by our permission.
