Another day, another dime; another day, another pound.

## Finance

Not a lot has changed in this theater since I last wrote, although I will be designing a realistic budget for the upcoming move and for the time thereafter at my new place. I want this place to look cool, but unfortunately, typically "cool" costs money, even the inexpensive, used, cool whatnots will accumulate and cost money. I will be brainstorming free alternatives but unfortunately the real world is not the Net.

After two transfers to my Discover Card totaling about $850, my Citibank card officially has a $0 balance. Shifting funds from one account to another doesn't exactly mean the absolution of debt, yet it is good to a balance of $0 on its website. At the end of this month, I may or may not be out of debt completely. It really depends on May 15th when I am told how much money my insurance provider did not cover for an out-of-network UCL operation.

In some ways, I would like to take on a small, part time job, and though I am quite proficient of squeezing time out of my schedule, I don't believe I can wring out an additional 20 hours in consideration of my full time job, workout schedule, and upcoming summer classes. I'll have class 5:30-7:30 M-Th and I will still require almost a couple of hours for a workout session.

## Physical

I weighed in at 228 last night in the cardio room which is a contrast to the 245 amount that I weighed in at the doctor's office when I had my thumb checked. Cutting 17 lbs in 11 days is not a bad feat. My personal best was dropping 16 lbs in one week last fall, but it soon tapered off. I did not have a workout program to accompany that initiative.

This morning, I weighed myself on our home scale and compensating for the 10 lbs that the scale is off, I was at 225. Of course, these are all fun facts and figures, but they do not make a primary impact. I am looking for performance. I can saw off a leg and lose all kinds of weight, but that will only hurt my performance.

I desire to build my stamina and strength (particularly my weak knee) for a trip to the Grand Canyon 3 1/2 months from now. My sister and Ed, my brother-in-law, are planning to embark on a hike from the South Rim, to the North Rim, and back again to the South Rim. They tell me it's a fifty mile hike.

I have been "freestyling" with my workouts. I will be implementing a regular, structured, strength routine soon, but for now I am conditioning my mind along with cutting weight and picking up some stamina. The key is the mind.

## Independence

As stated in a previous blog, I have been given the green light for the move to Union. This prospect excites me though losing an estimated 45% of my net income due to all associated expenses with moving out does not particularly make me gleeful. But I would not embark upon this if the pros did not outweigh the cons.

On another front in this theater of activity, as stated in a blog the other day, Lisa's complete departure from my life has occurred by my own heartfelt offer to her. Though I miss her deeply, more than those lost, carefree days of yesteryear, this event should release me from the shackles of old wounds. Yet, it's a hard transition to make when one is used to having the mindset of being open to another and then having to lock it away.
