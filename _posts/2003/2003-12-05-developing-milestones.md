The following excerpt is from John C. Maxwell's Your Roadmap For Success:

> If you live in a town near the ocean, you may have advertisements for ‘cruises to nowhere.' Maybe you've even been on one. People get on board a cruise ship, and when they leave the pier, instead of setting out for a lush island or other exotic location, they go out to sea and travel in circles for a couple of days. Meanwhile they dine on sumptuous meals, lounge around the pool, enjoy shows and participate in onboard activities. It's similar to checking into a fine hotel or resort.
> 
>The problem for a lot of people is that their lives are too much like those cruises. They're in a holding pattern, and they occupy their time pursuing pleasures or engaging in activities that don't have any lasting benefit for themselves or others. Meanwhile, they travel in circles. In the end, they finish no better than they started. A cruise to nowhere may be a fun way to occupy a few days of vacation time, but it's no way to spend your life.

As I read the above, it really resonated with who I am. I have some big plans in my life which are accompanied by various milestones. For one, I'm going to drop 78lbs, from 241 to 163. Why 163? It was the weight I had comfortably held in high school while I wrestled, though it will require vigorous workouts to reach, but as I pull the weight off of me, my ankles/knees should be more apt to meet this demand.

Yes, I have made such claims in the past, and though I did drop 40+ lbs, I never realized the goal I had set out to attain. Yet, this time, this milestone– this course of action, is empowered by a dream.

Another milestone that I must meet before venturing upon the joys of my epic is to eliminate the credit card debt I hold. Through aggressive reduction and sound budgeting, I shall soon find success.

During times of fasting, I find that through various conduits that I am drawn towards Scotland. I am exploring my existence, my vision for the future, during the month of December through heavy amounts of prayer and time in the scriptures.
