It has been some time since I have written in my blog, a pursuit which should be a near daily occurrence, yet something in which I have held off for I do not feel up to the task of writing toward the far reaches of my psyche's depths. Unfortunately, a good amount of time has passed since I have written in this venue and this in itself is a tragedy.

Though I was away, I have written quite a bit and perhaps I shall divulge some of those writings here. Jeremy moved this site back to his home server and with the limited upload bandwidth, my site is sluggish, but its great to use the resources of a static IP.

I will spend some time in the future to bring the reader up to speed concerning my present position in life, but until that time, allow me to share that I have been involving myself with the Loop and Highpoint church. It has been beneficial.

I do put a lot of pressure to perform upon myself and my lack of writing in here of late is clear evidence of that attribute about me. Once again, I am planning the revitalization of various segments of my life within the areas of discipline and training. Unfortunately, I have yet to find a solution with regard to my plans of the past of maintaining their success.

It is so easy to slide into comfort.
