What thoughts do I have to share with the reader today? Take care of your water appliances!

As I sat in my work area yesterday morning, a manager of mine spoke of how his clothes washer had sprung a leak, thereby shooting water across his place. Curious, I thought, but did not think much of it much further. On my lunch break, I stopped by my apartment and noticed a pooling of water from my water heater's closet. Alas! It must have started within the hour for a good bit of it was dripping from the unit, enough to soon soak a towel. I managed to contact the onsite manager and currently having the unit replaced. I was told by the handyman that they had another unit go bad the previous day. I understand in the main server room on campus had something bust which led to the flooding of the floor. Perhaps... perhaps I could envision all of this to occur in the wintery realms of January, but in June? Something is afoot.

Upon other matters, I had the opportunity to go over to U of M's president's house with Jeremy to verify an overheating issue with her pc. Essentially, the issue involves the disk controller overheating thereby making the drives unknown to the bios therefore disabling access... yada yada... no Windows for you! He had made that assessment earlier, and gave the advice that the unit not be enclosed in its wooden home, but the advice was not followed and "disk not found" occurred again. No surprise, eh? I guess they wanted a second person to verify that overheating was the issue and Jeremy invited me along to check it out. I don't do too many housecalls and definitely not in too many houses like hers. Apparently the University owns it. It's nice.
