The Ethan Hawke & Julie Delpy trilogy of Before Sunrise (1995), Before Sunset (2004), and Before Midnight (2013) are among my favorites.

I share this particular clip as it reminds me of a few lines from a movie I watched last night:

> I have a theory too. My theory is about moments, moments of impact. My theory is that these moments of impact, these flashes of high intensity that completely turn your life upside down, actually end up defining who we are...
>    
> ...The thing is, each one of us is the sum total of every moment that we ever experienced, with all the people we've ever known and it's these moments that become our history. Like our own personal greatest hits of memories that we play and replay in our minds over and over again.
