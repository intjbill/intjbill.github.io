When I do come off this fast, I don't want to grab a bag of Lay's and plop myself in front of a Netflix marathon for a slow-while-frightening fervid march back into the 300s. But outside of Christian Bale career, who would follow that pattern in any weightloss system? Why the failure?

Clearly, as Professor X as I'd like to be, I cannot tap into the mind of everyone—just a few:

* Think about a chimpanzee...
* Think about a chimpanzee using a banana like a grenade and lobbing it your way...
* Think how it explodes Jell-O all over you...
* It's lime...
* A Bill Cosby sweater hangs ominously in the shadows...a disembodied "hey, hey, hey" hangs in the air.

There, see? Master mind-control. Now you're FREAKED out of your mind and covering your drink. That said, I only have my own perspective. When I examine my weightloss failures, it is generally due to it not being not organic to my lifestyle—hey, I've established a extensive tradition of what economists would call utility maximization, but what you and I would call a bit laid out in a Jim Gaffigan routine. Outside of a few extraordinary circumstances, past pushes were not sustainable once they move past their novelty of newness.

Success that I have had were ones when it was "just what I did." I didn't have to plan; it was just my goto option. Clearly, fasting doesn't fit in those parameters, and hence why it should only be brought in as a catalyst. I'll read about intermittent fasting and it just makes me shake my head. Emotionally, intermittent fasting is unsustainable out beyond eight weeks or so. Either go all in or go to the arcade. Don't hanky panky around the beach.

So how do I change my goto options? I'm using this catalyst period to establish them, rethinking what food is (and what it is NOT) and funneling those principles into their subsequent actualization. I'm dreaming of tomorrow and what it takes to get there. I suppose there's always details ad infinitum, but that's basically it.
