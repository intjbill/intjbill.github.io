I am a character out of 1985's Oregon Trail, about a day's journey out of Independence, Missouri. I'll be taking on additional supplies soon, as an order I made with Upton Tea will be coming in this week. It's one-hundred grams of a 2nd flush Darjeeling, 125 g of a broken leaf Darjeeling, and another 125 g of a Japanese sencha. We're talking about 300 double-steeped cups of tea to spend the season fjording rivers and whacking varmints across the plains.

I am in Night Two. I am soaked by the full might of a focused confidence. That said, I am reminded that I was here just days before, but failed by one hour of reaching Night Three. Victory can be stolen by just one fumble—one lapse of focus...

...I come off like Apollo from Battlestar Galactica s3e15:

"One is the only number you need to remember. Because all it takes is for one pilot to let his guard down, one ECO to miss a DRADIS contact, and suddenly the Cylons are on top of us."

So yeah, it's kinda like that—just with digital dysentery and oxen oblivion.
