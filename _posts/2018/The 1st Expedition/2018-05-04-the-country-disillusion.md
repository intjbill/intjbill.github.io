For all that was spectacular about yesterday's Ancestral Music was flipped in the other direction with this morning's music. Check out these two from yesterday; they're awesome:

I had looked forward to for my days my Friday morning with Today's Country Music. I don't know if I've changed or it has moved on, but I just couldn't get into it for a workout session, despite being broad with my choices, whether love ballads or hard band metal ecstasy. Clearly, it's just me, for an entire industry has buy-in, but it just sounds to me like how pop used to be. There's WAY too many songs for my palate about phones and text messages. I mean, yeah, we had one back in the day, and it was Travis Tritt's Here's a Quarter, Call Someone Who Cares!

After my initial thrust, I chose the Wild Country Spotify playlist. A few songs in, there is a song by an artist with the name of Cash Campbell. I thought to myself that here is a guy that could be really good, or he might as well just call himself Garth Strait to attract playback. I listened to his Don't Wanna Think About It and just shook my head and didn't want to think about it. That CAN'T be Country today.

Like the Vedder lyric, "I changed by not changing at all." I immediately flipped to an old favorite from '96 that might as well be today's Country:

To help me through the rest of my iron session, I quickly threw an emergency playlist for this sort of thing and whipped out my mullet:

* Rock You Like A Hurricane – Scorpions
* Round and Round – Ratt
* Cum on Feel the Noize – Quiet Riot
* Nobody's Fool – Cinderella
* Turn up the Radio – Autograph
* Iron Fist Main Titles – Trevor Morris
* L'Estasi Dell'oro (The Ecstasy Of Gold) – 2004 Digital Remaster – Ennio Morricone
* I'm A Dragon feat. Sway – Original Mix – Apashe
* Memphis Fight Song – Memphis Tigers – Live – The Mighty Sound of the South Marching Band
* Not Strong Enough – Apocalyptica

So, I'm back to the drawing board for what I should play on Fridays, my Arms & Abs day.
