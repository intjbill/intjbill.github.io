Another solid workout, and it could very well be my most strenuous workout day, despite being a "rest" day for my resistance and pre-Chirunning regimens. The only issue I had was again with this soon-to-not-be-gimpy foot. As it was a foot-focus kind of day, after a few minutes onto the treadmill, I had to switch to the bike due to the pain, to ultimately avoid injury. I'm always a little irritated when I have to do that, but again, this is not for achieving 30 minutes or a day; this program is about the multi-month haul—it ain't the Superbowl; I got tomorrow, too.

I'm beginning to envision the fall season—oh, not the specifics of reps or any of the sort. Rather, it is the value of community and the type of people I'd like to interact and surround myself with. Not that we can ever be static, but a trend toward a particular approach to life. And honestly, traits that I work to develop within me.

**Positive:** Honestly, it's FAR too easy to be critical-lazy. Look at any blowhard Net post out there: not only is it antithetical to goal achievement, it's just VERY UNATTRACTIVE. There are ways to honestly bring up issues and potential risks in a very positive, goal-achieving approach. But, that involves work when most folks tend to just emotionally vomit on people.

**Cool in their Confidence:** Hey, I'm awesome. I keep it a secret. Folks that say they are, followed by a bunch of "me, me, me's," need more awesome in their lives.

**Grounded & Awesome:** Hey, while being an awesome, cool cat, we can recognize that we are (worthless and) weak in other areas. Look at a dungeon group: 3 DPS, healer, and a tank...FTW. Awesome tanks suck at DPS and so on. I gravitate toward people who are adept while freely admitting that they are weak in other areas. Even ol' Midas's touch had a fatal failure.

**Don't Be an Uncle Rico:** We all have have our failures...our letdowns...times when a black mark is put into the loss column that have shaped us. But, we ought not to overtly breathe from that moment and most certainly not espouse it! I quickly become dismissive of those who attempt to suck me down into their self-propagated, well-worn tread nightmare. If I may misappropriate from The Talented Mr. Ripley, they "can be a leech...and it's BORING." They can boohoo on their own dime; I'm all out of Kleenex. We ALL go through heartbreaks—that doesn't give us significance—and shame, SHAME on those who use it as an identity. As the Shinedown lyric goes, "I'm so sick of this tombstone mentality."

Instead, they can show me how they turned around what seemed like a loss to a win—BUT only to use it point to the future. But, most of life, c'mon [we're on to Cincinnati](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=agZKF7U5s8A).

**Be You**: Refuse insufficient identity; don't accept a cardboard cutout life. I don't pay attention to what's cool or trending. I haven't since '95 when I chose to move from the "popular" lunch table to the coding geeks. I'm thumbs-up about quirkiness and having idiosyncrasies. Having a niche or two—be an expert—goes a long way!

Anyway, those are a few areas that I would look for in members of a community that I would like to be a part of in whatever interest I pursue, whether a martial arts school, a running group, a gym culture, or even a tabletop consortium. Oh, and mega points if they agree Picard is superior over Kirk...but Adama is the Admiral.
