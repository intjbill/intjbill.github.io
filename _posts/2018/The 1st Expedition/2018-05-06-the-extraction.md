I have a sneaky suspicion that I have a strain to an intercostal muscle underneath my right lat (1. [link](https://www.healthline.com/health/intercostal-muscle-strain), 2. [example](https://www.webmd.com/fitness-exercise/features/todd-hundley-strained-intercostal-muscle#1)). It makes sense...there's sharp pain when I breathe deeply and things like sitting down and reaching up or down are always accompanied by a jolt that makes me yelp.

As much as I hoped that this was just a fleeting pain of the day, instead it will make me change my workout regimen for the next 3-6 weeks. While I've made some awesome gains these past four weeks with my workout, I'm going to transmute this letdown into a win. *poof* "Tada!" I'm entering the last week of my first six-week stretch, when I will be weighing on May 14. Whereas I had hoped for a hard-hitting interpretation of my workout to maximize weight loss up to the weigh-in, I'll be switching the routine into a cardio focus.

I went through the motions of what resistance I could save and...yeah, nothing. I mean, I could do some of my Arms & Abs day because I could work my biceps, though I'd have to avoid pulling the weights off the rack. And clearly, my 3x week abs are a no-go. Surprisingly, an exercise ball is pretty solid for me as a chair as it keeps me upright.

My Tabata will have to be on hold, along with most obviously my Taekwondo forms since that was the catalyst. I'm considering on performing a slow motion version of the TKD patterns, more of a pressing version, not unlike some of the movements in [Kwang-Gae](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dSmzxuompF0). I'm even considering teaching myself Tai Chi.

Since I will likely require further healing than a week, it's time to consider what the next six-week period will look like and I'm excited about it. Its weigh-in date is June 25, which is the precursor to my Chi-running in July, which hinges solely on as to whether I'm under 200 lbs.

Thus, this last week and the the next period are critical to get there. My nutrition rocks and can put me in the position to win, but I know I need better endurance...so this injury is a win: it channels my focus in another direction with enhanced cardio.
