## Today

As I've continued in these days, it was a 4AM morning. It wasn't to rush out and do flys or anything; I cycled a 5-min warmup on the bike, but that's more of a coffee alt than anything else—no, this morning was simple: to be. I went out on the front porch and looked deep into the night sky. I walked upon the highway and stood across the double-line and grasped the stars. I stood there for a moment and reflected how I could never do that on Union Avenue back when I lived at Georgian Woods or near the corner of Union / Cooper while on Linden. There in Memphis, it was hard enough just to see the stars, much less the expanse.

While I rest from my 5-day resistance regimen, I had a workshop cleanup slated for this morning. I chose not to, sans one thing; let the reader know: CARBS KILL. It amuses me that while on my low-carb diet, I use carbs (peanut butter) to kill mice. One of my traps is akin to an obstacle course TV show: the mouse must climb a wooden beam up the trash can and walk across a clothes hanger that perilously suspends above a watery death to reach a smattering of peanut butter on a spinning Pancho Cheese Dip cup. Two failed this week, but I really don't know their attrition rate after this morning. You see, I set up four conventional mousetraps. Three of the four had the peanut butter licked clean. The fourth...well, he won't be coming back for next week.

## Friday

Not that I have been entirely resting since the end of Friday's routine. After doing piecemeal maintenance on my John Deere x500 this past week, I finally got to fire her off a couple hours before sunset. It was the first cut of the season and I wanted to knock it out before this weekend's coming storms. For the future, I just might picked this timeslot: it was great to mow after the passing of the sun—the gusts of breeze were inviting. And toward the end, I opened it up and flew. I don't know if it was my diet, my training, or that I wasn't running it like I usually do around noon, but I didn't feel taxed afterward like I usually do. All my life, I've grinded it out with nature while the sun was at its highest. I stumbled across this approach simply out of time-constraints.

## Saturday

I drank my coffee alt. I heavily considered spending time Saturday morning on improving my cardio. As that will increasingly be a focus in these upcoming weeks and months, I chose instead to spend my 4-6AM time slot to clean up and re-organize my gym now that all of my workshop things have been removed. Consequently, it is even more inviting—even more my personal haven. I've got 36-inches between equipment, which seems ideal to me. I look forward to using this space as I'm implementing a program specifically for me as I include each exercise for a specific reason, as opposed to the general shotgun approach I suspect most train, the "I do it because it's good for me?" mentality. If you don't have a specific goal, you're just gnawing on peanut butter.
