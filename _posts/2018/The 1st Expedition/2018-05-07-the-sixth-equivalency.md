Today kicks off Week 6 of my overall program. I'm excited about climbing atop the scale in a week. Yet, I have these days ahead and it remains ambiguous. Don't get me wrong, this injury has given me a bright challenge to answer, but I hate that the momentum is lost—only in the sphere of workouts, however. My nutrition is rock hard...and if I may misappropriate the lyrics from a KISS title with the same words:

> You make me sweat, you turn me 'round.    
> You get me up, you never let me down.    
> You make me rock hard.

Yeah, that's MY diet!

I haven't figure out the puzzle as of yet: this morning was another 4am; I tested out the slow-mo TKD, followed it with some incline on the treadmill, and then intervals on the bike before going back for more incline on the treadmill. I just couldn't find my rhythm. I MISS my resistance! It just feels incomplete without doing the back, abs, and Tabata that was scheduled.

My injury is the type where the pain is diminished, if not absent and replaced by tenderness, if I slowly slide into an extension, not unlike how a slow stretch reaches further. I'm playing with the idea of adding a resistance program that, if not now, could be applied later; one moves away from concentrating on the chest once a week and instead hits it three times a week with less ammo. In that approach, I'd combine my other workouts—I know, pretty obvious!

While it may seem I might be leaning toward overtraining, I'm actually reducing things. Our bodies don't work in isolation. As much as I might prance around saying today is just a back day or whatever, the body works in unison to achieve an objective. Maybe at the core, it's why I find bodybuilding suspect. At this time, I see my iron workout as just a bridge to replace it for bodyweight training when my strength increase intersects with my weightloss. Who needs iron when one can just crank out pushups, situps, and chinups? Again, it's about moving my body in space. But, again all of this is academic for now...

Now, I never want to just focus on the details of today. I haven't talked about my return to Facebook since I don't want to overlook what I'm doing, but my return will be a major milestone for me—not working out, though...more of a secondary pursuit and just another source of motivation. Yes, OF COURSE I hope to showcase my harvest in September and pop open a six-pack...

...BUT...more importantly, I hope to reconnect with others who have enriched my life; I want to thrust my hand out in space and save my friends & family from the sands of time. I've purposely chosen to be disconnected from everyone for such a time as this. All of this training is about coming back. I will do my best to reunite the fleet...
