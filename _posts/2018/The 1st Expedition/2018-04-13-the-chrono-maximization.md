Today marks the end of my first week of my resistance & cardio program. I've now got the blueprint of what April – June will look like, though expect changes for next week, as I want to lay the foundation for the cardio influx come July. And I really want more skills work in martial arts and more ab sets/sessions

This workout's playlist, alternative from 1994, hit the right groove for me:

* Better Man – Pearl Jam
* Basket Case – Green Day
* Interstate Love Song – Stone Temple Pilots
* Loser – Beck
* Come Out and Play – The Offspring
* Vasoline – Stone Temple Pilots
* Black Hole Sun – Soundgarden
* About A Girl – Nirvana
* Mr. Jones – Counting Crows
* Shine – Collective Soul
* Cannonball – The Breeders
* Fell On Black Days – Soundgarden
* Big Empty – Stone Temple Pilots
* Self Esteem – The Offspring
* Far Behind – Candlebox
* Zombie – The Cranberries
* Return To Innocence – Enigma
* Fall Down – Toad The Wet Sprocket
* Spoonman – Soundgarden
* Sabotage – Beastie Boys
* Yellow Ledbetter – Pearl Jam
* When I Come Around – Green Day
* Fade Into You – Mazzy Star
* Selling The Drama – Live
* Stay – Lisa Loeb
* Elderly Woman Behind the Counter in a Small Town – Pearl Jam

This morning was an Arms workout. I'm further away from the Jumanji footprint, but the spirit remains:

* 5-min bike warmup
* Dumbell Curl (run amt up and back down): 2 sets of 20,15,10,15, 20 reps
* Standing EZ Bar Curls: 8×10
* DB Concentration Curl: 5×12
* Hammer Curls: 3×12
* Reverse Grip cable pushdown (run amt up and back down): 2 sets x 25,20,15,12,20 reps
* EZ Bar Skullcrushers to Close Grip Press: 4 sets x 12-20 reps
* Dumbbell Kickback: 3×12
* 30-min treadmill to 6AM

In conjunction with my missing to beat my alarm clock to 4AM today (I try to wake up on my own 10 min before) and a long resistance program, I didn't have time for a Dumbbell Triceps Extension: 3×15 and couldn't attached the last segment of bike cardio. I tried to compensate mid-workout by adding quick 45-second bike sessions between routines that had a rest gap, though honestly I prefer workouts where one arm rests while the other trains so as to minimize downtime.

So there you have it, my first week of training. While I have the next two days set to rest, I do have some side projects (like organize my workshop) and I may just comeback for a little cardio.
