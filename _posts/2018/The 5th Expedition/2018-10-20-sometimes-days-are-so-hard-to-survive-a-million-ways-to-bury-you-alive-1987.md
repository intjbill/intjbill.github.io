I'm bringing my FitBit back online. After everything I said in my last post, I realized that maybe I can both preserve and maul that proverbial cake.

I reworked The Wall to include:

1. Hours slept to setup each day;
2. Calories burned as estimated by my treadmill and elliptical;
3. Minutes performed in a resistance routine;
4. Daily steps to 7:30 PM;
5. Calories consumed for the day.

For all of its tedium, [successful sleep is a sneaky component of weightloss wins](https://www.healthline.com/nutrition/sleep-and-weight-loss).

To make room for the additional data columns and for clarity, I removed the columns that didn't contribute much information for my daily purposes: macro % and net carbs— strategically important, but insignificant for me to see on a daily basis. Finally, I took down the star system as its checkbox approach that wasn't working for me.

I broke the 53-row, mega table apart so as to have a table for each week, again for clarity.

Lastly, I created a summary table on top to provide daily averages by week.

My hope that this new version of The Wall will strike down inactivity and promote additional gains.
