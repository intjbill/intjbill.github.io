I'm reminded of Halloweens of nights past, specifically, the Reformation Day party I attended in 2002. It was the coolest event on Halloween that I had ever attended—at the time, I wasn't even Reformed! I was living with a couple buddies of mine in a rougher neighborhood outside of Midtown just north of Jackson Ave in Memphis. Across the street, there was a strange bubble of a place. Inside lived a 7-foot, online day trader who had attended Harvard, Yale, and Oxford and married a wife from Scotland. The house literally had a bookcase attached to each wall—and not just any books, but only theology. Very impressive. He invited us to his party and it was us and pastors from across the city. Toward the end of the night, he rolled out a wheelbarrow that was full of books and told everyone to take one. I took a C.S. Lewis text.

I remember trudging through snow at the airport on my last night in Anchorage on that Halloween night four years ago in 2014, moving back to my home state via backpack and a couple of checked bags. It was a night of frenzied activity, something akin to Home Alone, moving out of an apartment as the taxi company elected to just not pick us up without giving any heads up. Nevertheless, we successfully boarded the plane and the only Kevin left behind was my donated GMC Yukon. It was an overnight flight that eventually led me to be in Memphis the next day. It was a transition from the winter, back to autumn. As I stood looking out from high above in my room at The Hilton Memphis, I was taken back by how green everything was.

And now, I'm prompted by this Halloween, a transfiguration of potential as I further reap the results of continued weightloss and setup for Spring 2019 studies.
