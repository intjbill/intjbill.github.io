Two weeks from now, I'll climb atop that medical scale of mine, and see what kind of results I pulled in The 5th Expedition. It won't be close to the production of The 4th Expedition, a sixweek lb loss of 14.9%, the best out of all Expeditions.

That said, I would like to beat out The Second Expedition's 10.8%. Though the two periods dealt with different weights, I may have a shot at beating it. While the first half of The Second was comparable to my current calories, I experimented with a keto diet and was about 242 calories a day more than I do now (1185 kcal). But on the flip side, I spent more of mornings in my cardio...

And quite honestly, with 2/3's of the way there, there's not a lot that I can do; I should beat it, however. That aside, it's a milestone, not a destination. For all the pavement that I've passed this year, I've got a long ride ahead. And big picture: it's just a component of what I'm trying to accomplish. Yet, I really do hope I'm around 215 in two weeks, putting me in striking range for a sub-200 New Year's.

## What Happens in the Monomyth When the Supernatural Aid Just Doesn't Show Up?

While I thought my future was multi-pronged, things are in doubt. Yesterday, my biggest issue was just that I was pressing to have time to get prepared for The First Day of School. Yet now, pivotal questions have arose regarding financial aid. While previously I had it on authority that everything was good, in practice, this gambler may be out of aces. I've made an inquiry and I'll see in the next few days which fork in these woods I'll take.

I don't care "'cause when the feelin's right, I'm gonna run all night."
