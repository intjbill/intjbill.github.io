Yes, I want it ALL!

I want to...

* Drop weight to reach 155 and beat out my 163 lb high school wrestler frame;
* Run 5Ks, 10Ks, and half-marathons culminating into my 1st marathon in 2019;
* Achieve 10-12% body fat by EOY 2019.

That comes off as an early New Year's Resolution list, doesn't it? It's a veritable series of S.M.A.R.T. goals. Clearly, the work I've done in 2018 is a bridge into 2019.

HOWEVER, I've got another iron in the fire for 2019 that could make a huge change in my life. More on that later...
