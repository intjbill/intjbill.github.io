It's good to be a University of Memphis student again. I have so many memories there that I even have memories from buildings that no longer even exist! So many people in my mind— who knows whatever happened to them all? Honestly, I don't want to know. I'd rather remember them young and full of vitality. If I were to see them today, it would depress me. It's funny: way back when I was 18, as part of my 30-hour a semester scholarship hours commitment, I was assigned to work in the School of Accountancy and continued every Fall and Spring semesters for the next 4 years. And now...full circle...

Yet my love for my alma mater and former workplace is not the chief reason why I'm stoked for my return. It is in all of the possibilities that lay ahead. It's about putting the work in, hours everyday, daily investing into...myself. That's something I didn't realize when I was young. Back then, it was just to doing the work to get the check marks. Today, I push for me. I no longer pursue that diploma as the golden ticket for job admission. I pursue knowledge...for a purpose. To build something. The diploma will be a physical manifestation of the time I spent in training...

...it's hardly the end. ALL of this is the setup for the beginning.

This is the prologue...
