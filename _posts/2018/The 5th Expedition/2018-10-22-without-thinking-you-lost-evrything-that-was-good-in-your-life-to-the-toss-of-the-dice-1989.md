As it has been said in '94,

> It's amazing with the blink of an eye, you finally see the light. It's amazing when the moment arrives that you know you'll be all right.

I'm feeling good about my new cardio calorie approach regarding calorie vs. minute completion. It allows me to have a fuller knowledge of what exactly is going on. It's easy just to put in a workout and ignore the process. Admittedly, when training, I don't want to be fully aware of the minutia. I find if I do, I go more intense—sounds good, but if I fire the afterburners, I may have nothing for tomorrow's workout. It's always a tug-of-war between intensity and endurance/longevity. Frankly, it's all about optimization. Sure, I wish every workout was an all-out effort with no repercussions. I also wish I could lift my arms over my head and fly. I might even fight crime along the way. Fine, fine, I really wish for a Bat Cave. All right, I'll settle for a DeLorean with 1.21 gigawatts.

Loftly aspirations aside, keeping track of calorie output should yield enhanced results. That said, any ambitions to bring weight training back into the fold have now been shelved. The calorie count just isn't there. Yes, resistance is great for build creation and definition, but that's just not what I'm doing here. I'm strictly taking the weight off; again, I just won't be building muscle mass at a calorie deficit. And clearly, I'm dropping mass. When I need muscle mass, I'll get it, though I can't quite think what for beyond body movement—chin ups and such. I have no interest in lifting heavy bars, simply because I never run across that in the wild. If I want to be better at an activity, I do that activity. shrug

To assist me, I created a Google Form to record my data. It's too much of a hassle to keep paper around and as I always have my iPad with me, it's easy to punch in the info into a form. On the back end, I have a pivot table to sum everything. I also include additional details, though I don't know if there's anything I'm going to do with it.

Change is happening, of course. Sunday afternoon, I tossed an aerobie around for a bit. Since it was a GREAT autumn day out, I pulled out a favorite, long sleeved t-shirt that I wore in 2017—yeah, I was absolutely drowning in it. I wound up wearing another t-shirt underneath it. But, I guess's that the difference between a tired 4XL t-shirt and my brand-new, Tiger Blue, XL Reebok Space-dye Performance t-shirt!
