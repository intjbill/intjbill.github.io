If my status on The Wall is any indicator, I've had a lousy training stretch. I haven't hit 20,000 steps in over a week and I only have 5 stars in a week—by far, the worst workout stretch.

The stars and step count aren't precise. It's just an indicator toward an overall approach. The calorie intake is a far more telling approach of my overall success. As it relates to training, since my approach is cardio and not resistance, the step count has a positive correlation thing going on to training status.

Lately, things turned south with it...

Can I be burning out without recognizing it? Physically, I feel fine with my morning, lunch, and dinner workouts. I just wind up lowering their priority. Of course, this is in context to the gym/neck stuff. Early the other morning, I even pulled a foot muscle while in that waking period of movement. gargh Waking up is so awkward!

I am moving away from FitBit as I examine whether its a motivator or a demotivator. When I hit my daily step goals, I recognize that it's something I passively achieve from a tactical standpoint and success is only achieved with a 40,000 foot view. As it is something I cannot substantially change in one workout, is it motivating? HOWEVER, I do find it demotivating if I fail to fall into my mark. Indeed, there were days when I put in more work, but is not reflected accurately in a step count. For that matter, a Fitbit doesn't know if I'm on a 0% incline or 15%. In fact, I am influenced to make it easier so as to have a higher step count to give the appearance of a better day.

Thus, if I intend to use The Wall as a motivational tool, I need one that better motivates. But, how I record my progress isn't the chief issue; clearly, an argument can be made that it exacerbates the issue.

I don't want to discount that on some level in my psyche, the possibility of burnout. Perhaps, that is poorly defined. I don't think it is so much burnout but a saturation. Morning, day, night— it is like I adopted a mindset of hanging at a Tube stop. Miss the train and I'll just pick up the next one. Sure, each workout has is different, but the mindset at its entrance is the same.

No, I need to restore my workouts to their rightful place. And to further promulgate less is more, I'm going to slash my workouts down. No lunch, no dinner ones AND trim an hour off the morning.

Instead of a generalized, unfocused approach of these past few weeks, I want an enhanced focus with specific reasons why I choose the things I do and how they will enable me further.

...ugh for now, it's another morning with this bleeping foot sprain.
