Today would have been my Dad's 81st birthday. I am reminded of the following Shinedown lyrics:

> Tell my mother, tell my father,   
> I have done the best I can   
> To make them realize   
> This is my life;   
> I hope they understand.   
> I'm not angry,   
> I'm just saying:    
> Sometimes, goodbye is a second chance.    

-and-

> All my heroes are dead and gone,   
> But, they're inside of me;    
> They still live on.    

Shinedown's albums, Somewhere in the Stratosphere and The Sound of Madness made a huge impact on my earlier academics. Those two were the soundtrack during my TEFL certification month in the Czech Republic. They are among the albums that comprise the sonic landscape of my life.

In my cardio sessions, I've made the switch from Parks and Recreation seasons 2-5 to...*BATTLESTAR GALACTICA*. Yeah, I'm bringing out the big guns!

## Scheduling the Tug-of-War Schedule

While I've been plundering time in my mornings for studies within my discipline, I've had to reduce the features of my workout to make the equation balance out. Up to now, I've been OK with that, because—C'MON, it just makes sense with respect to my development.

And while my diet alone cuts the weight wholesale, my physical regimen is the multiplier. And as construct 2019 Bill, I'm gonna need that added cardio beyond an hour of daily training...yet, I need to underscore my accounting studies.

So, how do I reconcile this?
