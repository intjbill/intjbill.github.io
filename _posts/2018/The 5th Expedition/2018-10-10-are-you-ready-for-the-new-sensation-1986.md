I am on a great springboard to hit the low-200s, specifically 215 lbs by November 20th. My intent in the 5th Expedition is to lose 30 pounds. My model forecasts that it will be done and incidentally, The Second Expedition did just that. Granted, I'm starting out at a much lower weight so the percentages aren't the same, although not unlike the last weigh-in's comparison to The F.E.

I feel confident I can beat out the earlier posted 30. By comparison, the first 3 weeks of it I still ate 50+ calories per day than I do now; in The Second Expedition's second half, I switched to a fatter macro diet (66%) and ate 244+ more calories a day (and was hungrier than my approach now). It may not seem much, but the math is there: 6124 calories or about 1 ¾ lb that I left out there in that six-week period. More telling will likely be my increased cardio sessions. With the 5th Expedition and my revitalized gym space, I'm working out past my previous 6AM for an additional 55 minutes. That addition alone can contribute in excess of a 5+ lb weightloss for the period with just a run-of-the-mill cardio.

Of course, the wild card is one that's always out of my control and that's my BMR decreased with the weightloss...and as I continue, I'll have to rely increasingly on workouts over a large BMR.

And when I get to 215, The 6th Expedition is for the remainder of the year and will bring me below 200 lbs to what I suspect the low 190s. But, it's too far out to give much thought.

But bringing it back to the present, I am in striking distance (14 lbs) of losing 100 pounds since the start of 2018.
