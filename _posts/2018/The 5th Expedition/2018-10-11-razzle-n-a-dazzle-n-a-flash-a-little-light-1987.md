Daily, I think about 2019. I think about not only returning to my high school weight, but actually BEATING it. Razzle dazzle! I've heard other guys talk and they sound like getting back to that weight is impossible, that as we get older, we're just resolved to being fatter—that's not my mindset. Sure, I had advantages in my teens that I don't possess now and was active, but I had an atrocious diet. I can beat my wrestling weight of 163 lbs—even if I'm an inch taller now.

Yet, as that's an interesting internal motivator, still, is it something that can go the distance?

I like the idea of a Facebook return. Oh, I HATE the platform itself, but that's hardly the point. I really haven't connected to people at all in years. I suspect most think I'm still Into the Wild-ing it up in Alaska. Those who met me after 2001 would have never considered me for any kind of athletic prowess. And who is to blame them—I carried excessive amount of weight in my nonvegan years. I won't lie: I'm looking forward to my How Do You Like Me Now moment.

Still, that is merely a perk. It's not what brings me back to the gym, time-and-time again.

I am driven by the change and what the change means. Becoming an enhanced version of myself.

As I have written before, I train...

...To move freely and interact in the world;

...To glide upon the earth and spring to the heavens above;

...To stretch out my arms like Wolverine and rail against the tempest of Death.

Now, how does achieving that change me as a person, or better yet, alter my approach to life? THIS is why I do the things I do that render my moisture-wicking, "dri-power" t-shirts into sweat-drenched clumps in the hamper.
