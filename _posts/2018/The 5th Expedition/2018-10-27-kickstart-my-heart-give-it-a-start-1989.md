As it has been said, "Kickstart my heart, give it a start!"

I'm really excited about this post for I've been setting it up for awhile. I'm going to cover a lot of upcoming changes which will put me in a better position to answer those fundamental questions of origin, meaning, morality, and destiny. I'm disinterested in changes for their own sake, rather I crave an approach where all the pieces interwork to reach a common agenda.

##Spiritual

My spiritual quads, hamstrings, and calves have atrophied in this season of my life. It was never my intent, I just lost focus in that discipline of my life. It's a daily practice that I've neglected and I'm going to fix that in these days leading up to Reformation Day.
I'm returning to my use of Logos Bible software. I have an awesome library on that platform, with a few selected titles and the Reformed Gold package.

Sidebar: Yes, it was just the other day when I announced my Desktop's move to Linux. I really loved my return to Linux Mint and specifically with Mate. Sadly, the Logos team has no solution for Linux other than to use its web app, which is a limited version of its desktop version and ONLINE, which, again, download speeds are an issue for me.

## Physical: a Twist of 4 AM

While I've been experimenting with 7+ hours of sleep. I feel like it has stolen some of my momentum from my cardio. So, I'm bringing back 4AM. But, I'm overhauling it. While I still seek further cardio progression and weightloss, I also don't want to take away from family time, dissuade burnout, and provide additional opportunity.

The morning schedule is as follows:

* 4:00 – treadmill
* 4:20 – elliptical
* 4:40 – treadmill
* 5:00 – elliptical
* 6:00 – shower
* 11:30 – 30-minute lunch cardio

**The Weekend:**

My goal is to perform only an hour of cardio a day. However, I'd like to explore methods of cardio beyond my machines. In the spring, I'll be running at parks.

## Mental Machinations: Business Research

Late 2003 into 2004, I evolved as an individual who just doesn't get amped-up over wealth. Some folks do, over cars, clothes, and "candy." Just not my style. That said, I do like money because it gives me options. The less I have, the more I'm boxed in; I don't like boxes. I like the freedom to consider strategy.

I'm finding a re-emergence of my interest in the discipline of business. While in the past, I shuddered at the driving point of capitalism—playing up greed/materialism—I recognize that this is the system in play, and any others right now is inefficient. Maybe 50 years from now, societal resource allocation will be replaced by automation through AI not subject to corruption. And while I'm dreaming big dreams, hey, there will be a great boon discovered in our solar system that will eliminate scarcity; perhaps we could upload our consciousness into virtual reality? Life is just a series of perceptions in our head, if that was manipulated, there could be extravagance for everyone...though wealth in of itself is a fool's game and even in a context where everything is a non-economic good, we would still have want. Oh, Ecclesiastes! Oh, how we still grasp that wind!

All that aside, I want to fire up my mental engines and explore the discipline of business. It's not an unfamiliar topic as I grew up in a small business home, earned a BBA, and later held an IT perspective in the private sector before going full-on university. There's been times I was a subscriber to the *Wall Street Journal* and the *Financial Times*. Yet, through this stretch of my life, I feel removed from business. I've got some great resources at my fingertips, and I would like to dive deep into those texts.

You see, I want to build something...some sort of successful organization. I know what I'm capable of; I know what I need to shore up. I can find some real success if I do my homework.
