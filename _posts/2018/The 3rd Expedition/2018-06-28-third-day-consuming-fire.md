Another morning, another cardio session.  This week, I've been foregoing my typical, hour of cardio followed by a 40-min resistance with a cardio closeout.  I relished my morning soymilk blend, it's thickness built on flax seed and sunflower seeds with a touch of sweetness from the cinnamon and a slight tang from a very much needed addition of potassium chloride.

It was another morning when I seriously considered extending my quiet time an additional hour into my cardio. I would reap so much from it—and we're talking about an eternal context!  Again, however, I chose to once again apply my 4AM for workout.  I felt like maybe I can use another part of the day for my reading...well, so forth and so forth.

I'm at a bit of a crossroads.  As much as I've been enjoying my training and getting healthy, I've been desiring more to wade into the deeper waters.  Admittedly, I covet those who have the opportunity to go to seminary.  It's not so much that I'm interested in a leadership role; rather, I just want to know more, use the information and create something of my own handiwork...metaphorically or even literally, though I have no idea as to what context.

I've had a desire to learn Koine Greek, that is, Greek from the time of when the New Testament was written.  I've scratched the surface of teaching myself, but without setting up a daily schedule, very much like what I do with my workouts, I'm not going to learn it.  I would find much value in reading the New Testament in its original language.  I love my ESV of course, and for now, I should make the time to read more of what I do have access.

For that matter, I have this great library of the [NICNT commentaries](https://www.christianbook.com/page/academic/bible-commentaries/nicnt?event=Academic|1000252) in hardback form—it's vastly under-utilized by me...and this ties back into my time limitations.  I could set up a schedule where I could work through passages of scripture with commentaries, but for now, I can barely get through my reading list and my chrono Bible plan.

But, this is what The Third Expedition has been all about. It's more than just cutting the calories and working out so as to drop weight.  There is a spiritual significance...one that is just as much as a challenge and systematic as my physical program.

I have such a narrow window for physical fitness for aesthetics.  But, the pursuit of God has application for the next several decades...centuries...millennia...ok, for all of time.

I don't know where I read it or heard it from John Piper (I think), but our deepest longings, those golden moments of the past, whether times in high school or college or those fun and free twentysomething age, is but a dim analogy for what we really long for...and that is our time in the presence of God.  That's my chief desire.  And as it relates to Jesus' Second Coming, I have no idea when that will happen.  It could happen this afternoon; it could happen 500 years from now.  But for certain, my death is coming...not some uncertain 1000 years from now, but if I'm like my mother and father, I've got just about 25 years left...and that's not even promised to me.  As much as health and physical fitness are wonderful pursuits, within the scope of the eternal where  my body will be resurrected anew into something that's gonna be awesome blossom, it is that much more important to develop my soul, to work through my sanctification.
