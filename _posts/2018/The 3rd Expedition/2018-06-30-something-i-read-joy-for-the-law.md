> ...joy is a fruit of the Word's transforming power. Modern man is plagued with unhappiness, anxiety, depression, and despair. Our age of material abundance has become a dark age of the soul, an era of spiritual poverty and dearth. The emptiness, barrenness, and ugliness of modern art, music, literature, and philosophy all bear witness to the sad plight of modern (and postmodern) man. It is no mere coincidence that this era of cultural barrenness and degradation has been accompanied by a culture-wide abandonment of biblical Christianity and the overthrow of the standards of conduct taught in the Word of God.

> How different things are for those who hold fast to God's Word! "The statutes of the LORD are right, rejoicing the heart" (Ps. 19:8a). Statutes are standing laws, universal standards, abiding norms; God has provided His people with such laws, standards, and norms in His Word. By these we are "to regulate our life in all honesty to the glory of God, according to His will."

> Such obedience to God's law is far from burdensome to the Christian. "His commands are not grievous" (1 John 5:3b). On the contrary, they are a way of joy and rejoicing as spiritual poverty gives way to spiritual wealth. "Thy words were found, and I did eat them; and thy word was unto me the joy and rejoicing of my heart" (Jer. 15:16). "I have rejoiced in the way of thy testimonies, as much as in all riches" (Ps. 119:14). Thankfully, there are at least some today who are turning from the lawlessness and confusion of the world of modern man and rediscovering the joy of living a life made orderly, productive, and satisfying by obedience to the Word of God.
