Another 4-6AM of training....though this time, it was pure cardio as I watched a UFC on DVD. It went fast and I moved quick, though toward the end, my tank was running dry.  The last couple of sessions have exhibited that behavior. While I would like to credit as some sort of breakthrough on my part, I think it is more likely the cup of coffee I drank to start my Bible study hour before my time in the gym.

I really love that time with God. It goes by far too fast.  I'm unable to put everything I want into it...I want to put much more meditation into it—all I do now is read, an exercise of the mind, but not in a manner that assuages my heart! Of course, it's a new exercise for me for 2018 and it'll take time to work into place.  What I go through is powerful.  Beeke's [Living for God's Glory: An Introduction to Calvinism](https://www.logos.com/product/28081/living-for-gods-glory-an-introduction-to-calvinism) is coming to an end and it's been insightful. The following is an excerpt addressing the contrasts between the believer and the world, though must of it is a quotation within the text. And while its pastoral application is inapplicable for my purposes, I find the dissimilarities particularly beneficial coupled with verse references for meditation:

> ...preaching must distinctly "trace the line of demarcation between the Church and the world," he says. Ministers must bear in mind that there are fundamentally two kinds of hearers before them—the saved and the unsaved. Bridges stresses the biblical support for this division:
>
> They are described by their state before God, as righteous or wicked (Prov. 14:32; Mal. 3:18)—by their knowledge or ignorance of the Gospel, as spiritual or natural men (1 Cor. 2:14–15)—by their special regard to Christ, as believers or unbelievers (Mark 16:16; John 3:18, 36)—by their interest in the Spirit of God, "being in the Spirit, or having not the Spirit of Christ" (Rom. 8:9)—by their habits of life, "walking after and minding, the things of the Spirit, or the things of the flesh" (Rom. 8:1, 5)—by their respective rules of conduct, the word of God, or "the course of this world" (Ps. 119:105; Eph. 2:2)—by the Masters whom they respectively obey, the servants of God, or the servants of Satan (Rom. 6:16)—by the road in which they travel, the narrow way or the broad road (Matt. 7:13–14)—by the ends to which their roads are carrying them, life or death—heaven or hell (Rom. 8:13; Matt. 25:46).

I'm unsure as what to do about my lack of time of that 3AM—who knew an hour could be so scant! I've experimented with taking away that first hour of cardio, but I like to have two-hour workouts.  And the evening's "procrastination" tends to have characteristics that lead to failure.  Of course, the day is more than the morning, but the morning tends to forge the will forward.
