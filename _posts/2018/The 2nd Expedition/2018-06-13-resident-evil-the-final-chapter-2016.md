## Workout

Another successful morning and this time I've re-integrated my ab routine into my program.  I paused the routine when I injured an intercostal muscle under my right lat. Since then, I attempted to organically perform ab exercises randomly in the day, but in the final analysis, it wasn't consistent enough for my satisfaction.  Thus, it's back on Wednesday.  But unlike before, I don't think I'll have them on Mondays and Fridays at this time.  I'd like to further development the regimen ESPECIALLY when I'm under 200lbs and purchase a Power Tower.  Can you imagine the ab possibilities?!

## Intellect Development

I'm so very stoked:  I now have access to the riches of a huge reserve of academic journals and databases. Now the challenging aspect is for me to organize what I would like to study.  I'm not one to read for the sheer joy of reading—it's why I have very few fiction pieces under my belt.  The last time I remember reading any was around my first born's birth and that was 9 years ago.  I was 8 books into The Wheel of Time series.  But even way back in college, my preference was for non-fiction....and in this pursuit of knowledge, I've always lamented that I could not retain every bit I read.  I guess that on some level, I had hoped that which was seemingly forgotten would inform me on a subconscious level. An aspect of published papers that I like is that they are typically meaty material in a condensed form. I don't have to spend days with the material like I would with a book—books typically have a lot of fluff in their construction to reach a mass market audience...ok, days would be an exaggeration of real-world hours.  Way back in Flagastaff 2004, it took all day for me to read DIet For a New America at 423 pages, but rarely do we knock out books in one sitting.

## Soul Development

I've made a couple more changes to this site.  I integrated the Daily Feed, which is RSS sources of Christian leaders that give me great insight, and I've added a reading list. The audio feeds are from a Reformed perspective and my life is greater when I have a steady diet of it. The reading list encourages me to continue to read through my personal library whether on the shelf or primary through Logos.

Over a year ago, I began a payment plan that ends this November for Logos Reformed Gold library with an armload of other handpicked books. Instead of buying it outright, I thought I'd budget money each month that I would have otherwise would have spent and forgotten about it.  It's not a bad strategy, and unlike Spotify/Netflix subscriptions, I'll have something to show for it at the end.  It's an incredible resource and far superior than all the Puritan books in the public domain that I can put on a Kindle for the resources are integrated and linked to each other. When I'm reading a book and it cites an early Christian author, I just have to hit the link and it pulls up that book (assuming its in my collection).

Back in 2001, I thought it was pretty awesome that I owned a parallel bible with 4 versions in it.  Today, I've got many more, though I chiefly hang out in the ESV...an ESV with a Reformation Study Bible module when I want it. And the commentaries!  When I'm in a particular passage—well, it's incredible the access I have to resources.  And I don't have to sit in front of a PC to read my books, but I can do so on my iPad.
