Just when I thought I was patting down Google's grave with a shovel, its arm thrusts forward from the dirt with an icy grip upon my throat.

I'm back on Google.  Why?

1. I use Google Fonts.  I don't use much; it's only Open Sans for body text and I could do without as my other fonts are hosted by me, though my WP theme connects to their service and likely so does a plugin or two.  Of course, as I skip across the Internet, thatched basket in hand, I download all sorts of Google Fonts.
2. My webhost, NearlyFreeSpeech, doesn't allow emails from a domain for which they provide its DNS. Makes sense.
3. My favorite terminal app (when I'm not on Linux of course), is actually a Chrome extension.  Wouldn't be a big deal if my Wodpress wasn't so locked down that to install/update plugins, I gotta go command line with it.  Sure, there's always workarounds, but...yep.

And look, have I stopped using YouTube?  It's still strewn all across this website.

Plus, who does standalone calendar apps anymore?  Everything seems to be online.  The Netscape suite is so last decade.
