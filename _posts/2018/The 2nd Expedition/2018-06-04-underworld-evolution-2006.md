This morning's feature: meh.  The writing failed to meet expectations—yeah, that brings me back to my English days.  But, if I'm honest, do I expect much out of a vampire movie with characters running around in patent leather? Or even just choosing a movie to accompany me through my morning cardio? It depends on which side of the line it falls upon: a detriment or a catalyst?
I dunno...I just found myself not carrying what the outcome would be.  It was like an A-Team show: 1000s of rounds of ammo being rat-a-tat-a-tatted off and only the red shirts are dying.  Even when one guy was dead, he popped again later in the movie. *sigh*

But, I never intended to write movie reviews or endorse movies just because i watch them.  No, the reason I share them is to share my weightloss adventure.  Maintaining a journal keeps my daily focus up.

It's the beginning of Week 4 of the Second Expedition, marking the half-way mark before my 2nd weigh-in.  Toward the end of today's workout, I admit, I was tapped—which is good, because that's what I WANT from my cardio.  The last 1/2 hour involved managing my left foot's ache.  Generally, the blade of the foot gets worse when I roll it, so I have to focus on lining it straight as I move, whether its the treadmill or the elliptical.  It's more intense on an incline, so I spent some time this morning with the treadmill set to 2% instead of 4% and even did some -1% stuff.  Of course, this was already after an hour on the elliptical.  It sucks and it reminds me how good I had it with my youth with workouts as hard as I wanted.  Though, the same could be said for the present, just sans my feet.

I feel good and look forward to the future, even if this foot needs to take a breather afterward as its ache slides down from its crescendo.  I look forward to September—not just for Facebook (and ultimately reconnecting), but the things that I would like to do then.  I hope to be in the position to run along the Mississippi just for the fun of it, not to reach another goal on the way to get where I'm going, but to glide upon the Earth and be me.
