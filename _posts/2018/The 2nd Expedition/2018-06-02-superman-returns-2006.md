Wow...Superman Returns.  If I wanted to watch a relationship-driven piece, I would have picked up a chick flick.  I guess all the spandex made him not so super...seriously, I had to just turn it off and shelve it. I'd usually save a movie for the next day if I don't finish it, not unlike what I did with American Made.  But, geez, Superman: grow a pair.  Ok, to be fair, I didn't watch the whole thing—does he grow chest hair in the second half?  Maybe Kevin Spacey creeped me out.  I don't know.  I just know what I watched and it was so slow with old girlfriend drama.  I don't care about your feelings, Superman...you're freakin' Superman—super strong, laser eyes, icy breath—YOU CAN FLY!  Yet, here I am, watching some nonsense about meeting your ex's lover.  *great sigh*

Hey, I have no problems with romantic films and rom-coms.  I've watched every episode of Gilmore Girls several times.  But, Superman:  stay in your lane!

All of this reminds me of my need to prepare a movie schedule for my cardio mornings.  I waste too much time in pulling movies—this time, one that ill suits my needs!  When it comes to my mornings, I need about as much sophistication as Wesley Snipes punching Edward Cullen in the face.

I slogged through parts of this morning, not at the speed I would have liked.  Before that, I woke up a little heavy and knocked over a fan.  Then to have to workout through the above nonsense...well, it wasn't optimal.  No, for my morning cardio, I don't need a lot of depth.  In fact, I tend to stay away from my more favored movies just by the very nature of what I'm doing. For example, I don't think I'd enjoy Blade Runner 2049 or Crazy, Stupid, Love while I'm slinging the sweat.

All of it is just a bridge to get me to where I'm going.  Of course, this is my last workout session for Week 3 of the Second Expedition.  As the days pass, I grow more exhilarated thinking about the fall time and my higher capacities.
