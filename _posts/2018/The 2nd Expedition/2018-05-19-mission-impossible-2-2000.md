A Saturday!  I clocked in a little extra cardio this morning for a few reasons:

* I could afford it;
* it's the last day of my training week;
* My feet were feeling great!

In the future, I'm going to have extra long cardio sessions on Saturday; it'll give me the opportunity to play longer movies.

If it wasn't for yesterday's rain, I wanted to do what I did last weekend at this time and that's to fire up the ol' John Deere and mow some fire ant hills down.  Normally, I'll knock over...10 or so mounds around my property each...honestly, I don't really count; I just notice the big plume of dirt that erupts after I run over their base.  Usually, I don't mind them much, except that just yesterday, they were running a long line right in front of my side door that I use all the time.  In fact, I picked up a bite from them on my foot despite stepping over it.  Since I picked up one on my finger and two more on a leg.  So, I set up a few borax sugar baits to see if I can knock 'em back.  You just can't stop the fire ant.  In the apocalypse, there's going to be a cage match with what remains of civilization between the fireant and the cockroach.

Of course, around 2PM today, I'll kick off a 40-hour water fast that end after Monday's workout.  I need to develop Sunday more than just a day of cessation.
