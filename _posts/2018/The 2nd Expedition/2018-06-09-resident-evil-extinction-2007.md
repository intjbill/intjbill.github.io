...it's not the Sun, I hit another wall in today's workout, one in which it got to the point I was too fatigued to keep pushing the elliptical and I still had 50 minutes left.  I rotated to the treadmill for 10 minutes, got back on the elliptical, went to do a couple of sets of crunches on the exercise ball, elliptical, then rotated in the recumbent bike...it was just a challenging morning.  My best performance came in the late stages after the movie was over with and I just listened to synthwave as I pedaled.

I skipped my shower this morning and will be making circles with the John Deere for the next 2 ½ hours in that never ending struggle with the yard.  After I drive out the trash to the sanitation station, I'll wash my morning's work off.

As what i ought to do about this wall that I'm hitting, I'm perplexed.   By way of comparison, my after lunch workouts are 40-45 minutes and are fast and furious—but, they're not in a fasted state. I wouldn't rule out psychological either:  perhaps movies alert me to my present condition whereas I can get lost in the music.

I suspect it is because of this lower low carb diet in an intermittent fasting context where my last meal is around 11AM.

Well, off I go:  it's 6:30AM and the yard ain't gonna cut itself.  It's gonna be a hot one later today.
