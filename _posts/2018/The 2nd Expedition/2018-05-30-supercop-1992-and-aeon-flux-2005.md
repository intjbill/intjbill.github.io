It's been another morning workout where fatigue smacked me down.  I made it through to 6AM of course, but not that at the intensity I expect.  It's a weird feeling:  I know I haven't pushed myself today to reach that level of exhaustion.  It's the same experience I've been stumbling through recently.  It's like my first  5-minute bike warmup for that transition out of sleep. But, instead of it dissipating, it just stays with me as I slog through the entire time—maybe I can resolve it by sprinting in my warmup?

As much as I'd like to attribute it to my low-calorie-while-RDA-packed diet in context to my workouts so that I can switch to a higher calorie keto diet—as if my 30 net carb wasn't low enough―if I were to take an honest stab at it, I'd say my late cardio steals from the next morning's. I may have to dial back from my daily 3 hours of cardio and return to 2 hours.  While the First Expedition had no issues, I did make changes this time around and my intermittent fasting might be the cause as well, considering that's 16 hours without food to empty the glucose stores and then follow it with two hours of intensity.

I don't know the cause,  It may be just a weird place on this adventure.   But, I'll try pulling back the cardio to see if it resolves since it's something I've already considered because I wanted to integrate resistance back into my training.  I've been very pro on cardio of late, with a stance of if cardio is better for weightloss than resistance, then I just be more effective...but, if I can't keep up the intensity with the added cardio, it just makes sense to take another angle at training, and add the resistance.  Though, I'd rather lift in the mornings than any other time, but that's my prime time.  So, I'll be developing a resistance regimen to apply.

I'm trying out replacing the 16 oz water in my soymilk blend with coffee for its metabolic effects.  I don't need it for alertness or anything.  It does add a flavor to my drink that's fun.
