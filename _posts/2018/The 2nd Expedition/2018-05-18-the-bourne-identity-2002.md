It's another Friday!  I love another session of filling up the vitamin dispenser. That said, however, this morning's workout was all out of rhythm.  It started late and once I was working the incline treadmill for a bit, my other foot began aching—not the one that I've been carefully bringing along in these workouts.  I got on the bike, tried the treadmill, but had to go back to the bike.  I couldn't the intensity I wanted.  In the last 20 minutes, even on the bike, I couldn't prevent the ache, so I stopped things early.  It was still 70 or 80 minutes of cardio, but I just wanted more out of it.  I may have to reevaluate my program to account for its accumulative effects.  I miss being twentysomething and could just roll out one workout after another.

...but I don't know if it's an age thing or its the fat that I'm in the process of shredding.

I'm dealing with the counterpunch of the poison ivy I wrangled with on Sunday.—arms, legs, ankles.  It's been 13 years since I've been hit so hard (and that was from an ultimate frisbee game out in Shelby Forest in a grooms party. This time was just a jump into the bushes in my front yard with a weed wacker.
