To kickoff Week 4 of The Second Expedition, I'm changing my macros.  Now, in the past, I've discussed the importance of the micros—that hasn't changed.  It's integral when going lower calories to that in order. I made sure my RDA is 100%, though I did take the liberty to pull down the fiber from 58 to 25. Now, both diets are low carb my first: sub-30 net carbs; and the new: sub-20.  That said, macros made a huge switch:

## 1st Diet

* Calories: 1234
* % Calories from Protein: 28%
* % Calories from Fat: 46%
* % Calories from Carbohydrates: 26%

## New Diet

* Calories: 1418
* % Calories from Protein: 24%
* % Calories from Fat: 66%
* % Calories from Carbohydrates: 11%

I'm seeking to move toward a meatless keto diet, though it may be impossible to bring the carbs down to 5% without some serious caloric buildup, which I'm disinterested.  I'm just a couple of tablespoons of olive oil from making it 20% / 71% / 9%, but bringing the calories up to 1657 makes me nervous.  I have to work really hard to lose 400 calories in the gym.

I continue with the daily intermittent fasting, albeit just my flax, almond, sunflower, soy protein shake for breakfast and a massive, 4-egg, 5.7oz broccoli, 3 oz cheddar cheese omelet for lunch.

Now it's almost noon and I won't eat again until after tomorrow morning's cardio.

I'm going to give this approach a whirl for a week or two and see if there's an added energy boost so that I can put more work into my workouts. I can always go back to my prior diet, but for now, I'm grateful for the less time spent chewing.  Eating can be a distraction in our day.
