I didn't realize I haven't seen X-Men: Apocalypse before this morning's workout.  Honestly, the X-Men franchise has a tired plot: "Oh no, humanity hates us, but we gotta be good and band together to fight a big, bad man who is likely mutant or covets mutants." Its tread is running thin.  I am drawn toward Wolverine, though I don't know if I'll start Logan tomorrow; beyond that, I wasn't able to purchase anymore of the series from the closing video rental store.

I had another morning where I ran into this block of fatigue.  I completed my 2-hour workout, but it was like I was slogging through mud.  When I felt the most stuck, I'd switch to a different piece of equipment.  Lately, I've been wanting to spend the majority time on the elliptical, but this morning I rotated in the bike and climbed atop the treadmill at 4% until my foot ache pulled me back down.  It's funny because when I workout after lunch, i know I will be fired up inside and will sweat like a sprinkler.

Not that I want to exclusively use this site for weightloss / health / bodybuilding, but it's what my focus has been on to achieve in this season of my life.  Success begets success.  This is all a start.

I'll be crossing the threshold of 40 years this summer and it does make me look back over my life, the places I've been, the people I've known.  And while there are people who are my age who toss back prescriptions for their "ailments" and slowly fade into the still waters of entropy, that's not me. If I may adapt: "it's better to ache out than to fade away!"

I remain excited at the 2nd weigh-in date of June 25.  I have the full expectation of blowing The First Expedition's 40 ½ lb loss out of the water.  While that first six weeks was significant, I've done more in this 2nd thrust to that end.  But, before I become too mesmerized by the near future, I gotta push through and reach today's gains.
