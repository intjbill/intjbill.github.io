No movie trailer today, because *Warcraft* ran over into today.  A fitting movie to end the last workout of The Second Expedition. I enjoy viewing my life as an epic adventure and the WoW universe was a companion of mine for a very long time.  While I have no plans to return to Azeroth, Thundercast—my Night Elf-turned-Tauren druid, a carryover from my EverQuest days; and Makyah, my Orc hunter, both have a special place in my heart.

While there will still be movies for my cardio time, it will be much less dominant.  I look forward to my UFC DVD collection.  My only regret is that I didn't pick up more from the now-closed video rental store as I made the purchase on its last day of operation.  I picked up 20 UFC videos or so for $10—not each, total—so, 50 cents each.  As a martial artist myself, it fires me up to watch it, which, in turn, ought to squeeze more performance out of me.

Ahh...cardio.  It was my all-cardio Saturday morning.  Two hours of exhilaration!  Am I overselling it?  Seriously, I'd put today's effort in the top-5 of my workouts for these past 12 weeks.  It's funny, too, because as I warmed up, I really didn't think it would be a good day.  But, I guess it was just something about the ol' Horde bashing the Alliance that revved me up!  About 80 minutes into my cardio, it was like a switched flipped on in me, opening up all sorts of energy, so naturally I pushed harder.  As what I like to do on Saturdays, I closed out with an all-out in the waning minute.  It was another every-inch-of-my-shirt-was-drenched kind of workout.

Tomorrow is a rest day that will bridge over into my weigh-in while The Third Expedition lies beyond.
