The Underworld franchise did itself a solid by releasing this movie after the botched job of the previous one.  It was like a gothic Gladiator meets Braveheart meets First Knight, just without the charisma of Mel Gibson's and Russell Crowe's characters.

The last two mornings have taken a lot to climb out of bed.  It's not due to quantity of sleep; I'm great about going to bed early for my mornings workouts.  Perhaps the diet shift contributes to it? While I've added 184 calories to my diet, I've taken meals away.  No longer do I have the 6:30AM | 9:00AM | 11:30AM | 2:00PM schedule.  Instead, it's simply 6:30AM & 11:00AM.

While, I'd argue I was already in ketosis with 30 net carbs, I've taken over 11 off that number and reduced the percentage of calories coming from carbs by 42%, from 26 to 11.  That may contribute to the challenges of kicking off my day.

I'm hoping that this shift will lead to greater weightloss than my prior approach, though there is no way of knowing.  It's not like I've got a control just laying around or an interdimensional portal to hop through.  While I can find the research of what works, my application is just guesswork. While I know my first diet shredded some serious weight, I'm leaping into the abyss with this new one.  But, in makes sense and the theory behind it is well supported. In the days to come, I'll be listing all the papers that I base my approach to awesome blossom weightloss.
