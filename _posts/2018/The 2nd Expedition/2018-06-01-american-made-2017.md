It's another Friday and another vitamin dispenser reset!

It's also...JUNE!  I'm in the process of developing a summer playlist for when I sunbathe.   

As the trailer above shows, I've got another Tom Cruise movie!  We made one last run at the closing video rental because of a deal that's really hard to pass by: 20 movies for $10.  That's $0.50 each!  So, something like $75+ later, I've got a new hoard of DVD/Blu-Rays to type into my spreadsheet.  Included in the mix is the entire series of Parks & Recreation, a relatively more expensive pickup as he charged $4 a TV season.  I picked up a great boon for my morning cardio: 20+ UFC DVDs.  I wanted action for my mornings, and I got it.

My morning cardio went awesome!  It seems that I'm past that threat of inexplicable fatigue that I was experiencing, and perhaps my shift to the more-intensive-but-legs-saving resistance+cardio workout instead of pure cardio contributes to it?  Or, it could be something as simple as now I'm hydrating before and during my workout—I wasn't doing that before when I drank more liquid afterward at breakfast. Or, was it just a barrier I had to smash through?  I like the latter best.
