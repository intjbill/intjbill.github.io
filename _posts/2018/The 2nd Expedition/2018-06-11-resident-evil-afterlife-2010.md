After a brief foray away from Spotify, I realized how silly it was, especially with respect to my workouts.  What am I supposed to do—hum to myself?  "Once, there was this girl who..."

I began this morning a little out of rhythm.  After A little delay out of the gate, I setup and began watching the next Resident Evil from 2012.  So....I had to hit rewind and flip through the 2010 installment's previews.

That said, from 4-5AM was cardio and I completed my Back program.  After moving my resistance regimen to the lunch hour, I'm returning them to the morning to increase intensity and to check them off my list for the day.  Then with what time remains, I'm back on the cardio.  Of course, this approach digs into my cinema time, but I can pick up the rest of the movie in my lunch, now cardio, workout.

I'm glad I reintegrated my resistance regimen because I've read a lot of abstracts on published papers on the benefits of having both cardio and resistance.  I haven't had the time (and in many cases the money) to read the papers themselves.  One of these days, I really ought to regain my subscription to JSTOR; it's about double the price of a single-use Spotify account at $19.50/m or $179/yr.  A little steep, but it's hard to ignore the value of developing one's mind further, and it was a resource I once regularly used.  In fact, I remember a grad class where I had to read and review 4-6 articles a week.  I try to read scholarly works regularly to keep my wits sharp.  For now, there's NCBI.
