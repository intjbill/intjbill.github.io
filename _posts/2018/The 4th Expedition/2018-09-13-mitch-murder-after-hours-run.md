When we face a challenging stretch—and this could be anything, not just training/dietary for life is systematically organic as nothing exists in a vacuum—we are left with two options:

1. Stay where we are;
2. Move.

Now, this may seem fairly obvious, but how often do we just stay stuck. Like "Oh no, I'm morbidly obese! The only place I'm going is to the ice cream bar!" We don't change our circumstances, but remain...stagnant, amidst a whirlwind of destruction.

I've been guilty of it as well, even if ignoring is a type of stagnation.

It is hard to move. It's...

* Reaching critical mass to push against the inertia;
* Leaping out into the abyss of the unknown;
* Changing status quo;
* Modifying priorities and realigning focus;
* Establishing a new rhythm.

Do we work toward a future or avoid the present?

And while there is value in being in the present with a healthy perspective—not some kind of defeatist/escapist viewpoint—it is optimal to apply our current vantage point while looking what lies out before us, opportunities and challenges alike. If we remain where we are, can we have say we have a destiny?
