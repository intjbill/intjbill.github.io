As I referenced yesterday, I supplement my morning workouts by going into town.  I regret losing my elliptical because there would be little need for me to take that morning drive.  But on the bonus side, I likely push harder, for being in that environment motivates me.  I only regret that I can't spend two hours a morning there.

Yet, as I said, I supplement my morning workouts with it.  Beginning yesterday, I've returned to that hallowed 4AM hour for workouts.  I've returned to my resistance regimen.  But, I do want to explore how I can add martial arts back into the mix to further develop mobility and agility.  That's critical:  I have absolutely no interest in spending time in the gym just to develop my selfie game.  That's something we have to ask ourselves:  why am I here?  How effective is this  exercise in aiding me to reach a specific goal?  Squats are a VERY common lifting exercise.  However, I can't think of one instance my entire life of that being a real-world situation.  But, we don't typically think in those terms—I know, I neglect it.  When I designed my resistance program, it was to hit the muscles with the equipment I owned.  I didn't think of functional fitness.

There seems to be a dogma that the purpose of these lifting exercises is to do more weight with those lifting exercises...which admittedly makes me turn my head.  And yes, those exercises make some impressive specimens, but are the results limited to performing reps?  I get it, though, some people really dig going to the gym and lifting up heavy things to put them right back down again.  And some folks like to oil their bodies and glisten.  I, for one, ain't no show dog, so there's got to be more to it for me.

But, all of that is talk is minutia—the bigger issue we have a society is not our workout approach, but working out at all...

I've got updated data tracking on The Wall.  I added going to the local gym and if I hit my breakfast, lunch, and dinner cardio meals at home.
