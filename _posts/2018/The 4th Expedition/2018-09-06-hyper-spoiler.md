I woke up throughout the night. One of those times was my scheduled 3:50AM. I sat at the side of bed, crescendoing to engage another 4AM workout and...experienced how sore my body felt from last night's impromptu session, and promptly fell over and sunk into the depths of my soreness.

I woke up again at 6 and regretted my weakness. Who says we can't train through the soreness? As the failure faded from the day's light, I climbed aboard the elliptical and charged ahead at a frenetic pace, falling behind from the gains I could of had that I can never have again.

To the right column, I've added a link to The Wall.  Typically when it comes to training, walls are a bad thing.  For me, The Wall, is a place where I post my dailies: achievements that energize me, or if a misstep occurs, a reminder to watch out for missteps as they seek to eviscerate their victims in the shadows of a blurred alleyway—how many times have I failed from this lack of awareness!  Currently on The Wall (though expect things to change), I list my calories, macros, and daily steps to 7:30PM.

Yes, I'm back on FitBit.  It's not a primary approach for me—that's diet of course, and it's not even a secondary source as that's my 4AMs, but think of it as more of a tertiary process of calorie burning—simply squeezing a little bit extra out of my day, finding moments that I could move instead of sit.  Weightloss itself is just a long series of small investments that pay off: 100 calories here, 100 calories there.  Adding a FitBit is analogous to that mindset.
