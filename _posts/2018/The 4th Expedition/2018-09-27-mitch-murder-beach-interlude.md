I'm upping my supplement game. I'm removing the following from my rotation...

* Iodine, 225 mcg
* Zinc, 25 mg
* Solgar B-Complex Stress Formula, ¼ serving

...leaving these in the starting lineup...

1. Vitamin D3, 5000 IU
2. B12, 5000 mcg
3. Calcium with Vitamin D3, 800 IU & 600 mg
4. Choline & Inositol, 250 mg
5. Triple Strength Green Tea Extract, 750 mg

...and the NEW from Vitamin Shoppe as I take these horses out of the stable:

1. Kelp
2. Cayenne Extract, 450 mg, 80,000 hu
3. Ultimate 10 Probiotic, 13 billion
4. [Vitamin Shoppe Ultimate Man Multivitamin](https://www.vitaminshoppe.com/p/ultimate-man-multivitamin-180-tablets/vs-2750)
5. Ginkgo Biloba Extract, 120 mg

I'm really stoked about the additions.  While I'm stilled keyed up about fat loss, I'm looking toward the future with better health and performance.

In a prior post, I referenced how much I've lost this year and the lbs I'm going to lose by New Year's Day 2019.  But, I need to return my focus back to where I find myself, The 4th Expedition.  Sure, the past is great and the future in the distance is fun to dream about, but it is imperative that I stay locked into the present.

I entered this expedition at 288. If I can get down below 247 ½, I will have beaten The First Expedition's lb success.  Now, clearly, it's easy to get big numbers with initial weight loss and a larger start—the math just works that way.  I feel really good about this 4th Expedition and it should outclass The First Expedition—just my involvement at the new gym alone can drive that sort of success.
