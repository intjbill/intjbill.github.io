My Fitbit shakes me awake before 4AM each morning.  With a groggy gusto, I shake off the tentacles of slumber, grab a carbonated water, and enter my private gym.  I flip on a UFC DVD, fire up Spotify, and climb aboard my treadmill for a 20-minute warmup.  I'll work over my bag for a bit―but never enough— and then return to the treadmill until it's time to drive into town for an hour-long trip on a elliptical and more UFC. After a loop or two of cool down,  I return home.  Later, there will be a 30-minute cardio session for lunch and a 45-minute one for dinner.

That's my typical workout day.

It'll change in due time, but it's great for consistency.  I don't run much.  That will change, too, when it's time.  I walk a lot.  Even if I'm in my 250's (I really have no idea until weigh-in), that's a lot of weight for feet—I'd speculate even for healthy feet.  And while I could start a running regimen today, increasing my endurance, is it something that I could do it everyday?  How long would my feet hold up?

Sure, ABSOLUTELY, I'd love the calorie expenditure an hour of running would give me compared to an hour of walking, elliptical, or whatever.  But, could I do an hour of running, Monday through Sunday?  And if I have to skip sessions to heal, how many each week can I afford to lose before the calorie expenditure is LESS than walking?  See, the weightloss game is all about one thing:  consistency.  Consistency in eating, consistency in activity.  One huge moment, one huge victory does not—cannot do it.  It's the little successes, all strung together that ascends to supremacy.

And I don't want to plateau.  I'm not happy hitting one speed and staying there.  As my stamina climbs and my feet lighten, I push the pace.
