I'm finishing up the second week of my reignited weightloss routine.  I'm in rhythm now; my appetite has shrunk and I no longer need romaine lettuce as a stopgap measure for the night.  Consequently, I'm now in the 16:8 intermittent fasting groove.

While my workouts aren't making similar strides—I canceled 4AM because of a late bedtime.  I still got up before 6AM and handed in a 64 minute cardio session and there will be more to come later in the day including what I hope to be a resistance one.  I'm putting in the cardio work, but the schedule and the resistance just isn't there yet.  Perhaps this warrants further consideration: lately, cardio is fun for me, but the joy of returning to resistance eludes me.

Again, I will tout the motivational effectiveness of my FitBit.  It keeps me on my feet more and I'll do extra chores just so that I can tally up the steps. I find it propelling to hit streaks for the hourly goals and I like the challenge of competing against my high score for daily steps.

Despite all the bustle of a workout, the crux of of a weightloss approach is the diet.

Throughout this time, I've maintained a vision of the future and work toward that goal. That is key.
