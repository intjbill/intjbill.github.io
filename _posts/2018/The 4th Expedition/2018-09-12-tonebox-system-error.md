I consciously made the decision to skip 3AM, 4AM—the whole bit out of frustration. But I never relayed that back to my subconscious for I woke up at 3:01AM with no alarm. And clearly, it wasn't due to an abundant amount of sleep: FitBit recorded I got a whopping 4 hours and 21 minutes.

I'm frustrated because in the past week, I've had my stationary bike go out followed now by my prized elliptical. I'm down to one last piece of cardio equipment: the treadmill. I will say it has opened up a lot of space in my gym, but I absolutely hate that my options have been reduced. Admittedly, I did lean heavily on the luxury of not thinking; I could just climb aboard the elliptical and knock out an hour with not a shot of pain to give me second thoughts.

In that context, I worry about a regimen that is heavy on treadmill usage. It's the direction that I eventually want to implement, but I'm not ready for it yet—or more specifically, my feet aren't ready for it yet. Even now, they're sore and I haven't EVEN done anything of consequence yet.

Thus, I've got to reassess my approach.

And while the loss of the equipment is frustrating, I just shake it off and advance.
