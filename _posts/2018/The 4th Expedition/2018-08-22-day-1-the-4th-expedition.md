I was wrong...well, partially. It's not that I necessarily disagree with my last post. Performance or fitness or whatever does not have a causal relationship (or casual for that matter), but there is a positive correlation involved—at the least here at this end of the scale where I have set up shop. And while a number in of itself as a weight measurement has little bearing on my appearance, ability or health, it isn't too shocking to say there is a correlation: we don't call 300 lb manbeasts agile, any more than we would talk about the turn-on-a-dime capability of an 18-wheeler or the explosive quickness of a Mac truck. And yes, I'm talking about fat and not a golem of a man. I'm talking about that warehouse club glut of adipose tissue that rams all the internal organs together like a London Tube 8AM commute.

## The Bizarro Bill Six-Week Expedition

I'm at 291. The lack of a commitment to a low-carb lifestyle stole a lot of my 71 lb success from the First and Second six-week expeditions. Now, a lot of this is false weight gain; at the same time, I've been a food junkie. I haven't kept tabs on my nutritional intake and have floundered down into a food lifestyle that I'm not proud of...I haven't debased myself down to Hot Pockets, but I've had a Totino Pizza or two. Yes, that is a sad Party Pizza for one. It comes in a bag; you know it's the best!

And while halfway into the Third Expedition, the fire died and I lived in the badlands for six weeks thereafter—yes, a Bizarro six-weeks, like the mirror universe of Star Trek: Deep Space Nine or even the upside down in Stranger Things—basically any dystopian pieces. Instead of a six-week Expedition toward the light while moving toward weighing and feeling light, I had a six-week 45 lb weight gain into the dark reaches of the night. I knew nothing of my 4AMs. I did not workout. I did not sustain healthy eating.

I've addressed this overarching failure in a prior journal so there's really no need to wield it in asceticism further. Though it is immediate, I now can push all of that into the past and actualize that though it has been part of my narrative, it's not what I'm doing now. There's freedom in that.

## The Return of the Expeditions and the Advancement

I had abandoned the Expeditions construct of a tactical/daily approach for weightloss in lieu of for a 30,000 ft grand stratagem. Yes, my big picture approach IS from New Year's Eve's Morn 2017 to 2018, but that's gotta be broke down to milestones; there's not enough incentive to fire up for today for something that is months in the future for its far too easy to let that future Bill take care of it. And I never recognize in the moment that I'm future Bill—again, all for the lack of 1.21 gigawatts.

So today, BAM, the Day 1 of The 4th Expedition. And as a reminder to the fall of The Third Expedition, my weigh-in is not on a Monday, but on Weigh-in Wednesday, every six-weeks. It's a reminder of how fast one can lose so much progress.

I'll be grabbing what worked in the past and adding a few more ideas that have been rolling around my head.
