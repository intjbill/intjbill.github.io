I dropped off my elliptical and recumbent bike at the city dump this morning. They met an unsanctimonious end considering all the work I put into them. And while I hated to take them out of my gym, I move on. Afterward, I put in 45 minutes on the treadmill.

My lower legs are transitioning well to the increased workload. My speed is basically governed by whatever threshold I don't feel pain. When I began to feel pain on the top of my foot, I slow the treadmill down so that the pain's intensity subsides. I'll throw in spurts of jogging, but I have yet to enter an interval approach.

In time, I suspect the pain will leave entirely.

Weightloss just isn't a snap my fingers and it's done endeavor. The BMR equation and the multiplier that lines up my weightloss earlier this year indicates that by EOY, I'll should be under 200; by March, I'll be in the mid-160s. It's not an exact science since I can't regulate how many calories I burn in my daily workouts—it is wildly variable considering mass and activity, but I hope I underestimated adequately calorie loss.

I'm working to be at a training weight of around 155 or maybe a high-carb, walking around weight of less than 170. I weighed in at 163 at the end of high school and remained at 170 into my first year of college. Thus, a goal of 155 is attainable. Naturally, of course, it's all about fat %, so 155 is just a shotgun approach for now.
