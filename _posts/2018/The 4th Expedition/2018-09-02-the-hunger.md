The biggest challenge I have in this diet reset is dealing with the hunger with respect to an intermittent fasting approach.  I don't recall having my last meal at 2:30PM each day being much of an issue last spring.  That diet was different, as among the differences, it also included a lb of romaine a day.

It's one thing to shift from one food source to another, quite another to make the swing to...hunger pangs.  Even in the discipline of fasting, I only have to deal with that 2-3 days and the appetite is gone.  It's not something I wish to experience night-after-night in this transition.  Perhaps in The 5th Expedition, it can be something I can integrate into my regimen.

I don't necessarily mind returning to romaine.  Yet still, I may abandon an intermittent approach if it risks my success.  What good are the gains I can achieve with that approach if it blows up the entire system?

This may be a resolution in the short-term, but I don't know what to do overall.  Yes, in this project setting, this solution works, but what seems to compel me to seek ill-fitting solutions?  Why do I grab low-density nutrition sources to meet hunger?  In fact, I don't even view my selection in terms of how it helps me; I just view them in terms of finding pleasure.  And that is systemic to the human experience.

All that I can do is push those things—that which provides pleasure in company of low-density nutrition—away from ease of access.  Although without amenities such as DSL or cable Internet, a benefit of living out in the country is that I'm far away from any sort of pizza delivery or Chinese takeout.
