It's a yard mowing Saturday, two hours of riding the John Deere around the yard.  You might think that this sort of thing is relatively labor-free when it comes to exercise, but it can be a bit of a core workout as my yard has all sorts of slopes throughout—and I didn't want to smash against the iPad on my back.  Since my phone is loosely put together, I chose to bring along my old iPad and backpack from my PhD days so that I could listen to Spotify. Yes, who knew that the same backpack I'd walk through the streets of London, Prague, and Plzen would 6 years later be worn as I mowed a country yard in Tennessee.

While I had my alarm set for 4AM, I elected not to go because I wanted to start the yardwork at 7 so as to slide in before the rain.  It was hard to gauge if I could go through a 2-hour cardio workout followed by another 2 hours of yardwork.  I've done it in the past, but that was in context of being in rhythm with my workouts, something which I have yet to achieve in this fresh start.

After further consideration, I'm going to keep my resistance program in the 2nd hour of my morning workout.  There's the physical benefits of it, the aesthetics, mental toughness development, etc., but I find value in it as a change-of-pace approach.  Yes, I could slowly lose steam through cardio, but I like the idea of a jolt of something else after an hour of cardio—even if that something else has cardio integrated into it.
