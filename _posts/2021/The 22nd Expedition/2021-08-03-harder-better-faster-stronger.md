While I don't really intend to be as prolific of a poster as I have been in the past, i.e., daily posts, constructed around a song for the day, I gotta admit: I do feel THRILLED to return here and open things up because I KNOW it leads to success! It's about a daily focus; if I may adopt an analogy from shooting: its about coming back and lining up my sight picture. You cannot do it once an assume you'll hit the target on every shot thereafter. It's not something that will do well on autopilot.



Of course, there's GOTTA be the desire to become better, to achieve the best version of yourself. I recognize that I'll never reach that point, but each day I want to be the guy that makes an investment toward that future. A driving motivation for me is that I know I can be smarter, faster, quicker, stronger—I am simply not satisfied with where I am today. And this is the sort of thing that is a lifelong pursuit.



Sure, when I was younger, I was indestructible! While I had access to better tools and time, I was no mechanic! It's like that Cinderella title, *Don't Know What You Got (Till It's Gone)*. Of course, the benefit of added experience is that added capability is unlocked because the biggest barrier, ignorance, is removed. And sadly, future me never did find the keys to that DeLorean to swing by my place!



While this writing is coming off like an Expeditionary restart, I've stuck to my diet. In recent weeks, my appetite has shifted. I once was a 2-3 lbs of meat a day guy, but lately, it's played out to be about a lb of meat. Sometimes, I'll throw in six eggs, but on most days I don't. I still do 2 tbsps of Kerrygold butter with coffee to make an iced 30 oz tumbler about twice a day. I've felt satiated, so why eat more? I've run across a few ribeyes that made it through sous vide that were SO GOOD! When I look back on all those months when I starved myself on dehydrated crackers made from spinach, broccoli, flaxseed and spices, I just shake my head and laugh! Yes, with time, added capability is unlocked as ignorance is removed. Only if I could justify paying for a ribeye everyday!



While up to now I haven't taken any supplements since becoming a carnivore, I've finally added one: 500 mg of krill oil. I'm giving it a shot to see if I can recover from this shoulder/arm injury faster.



In the near future, I've got two, new things coming up:


1. I'll be trying out a "bread" made out of egg white powder and egg whites to cycle between days.
2. Instead of signing up for another gym, I've got a spin bike coming my way. While I still want my roadwork to play an integral role to my development, I want it something that I feel stoked to do and fits my schedule. A bike is just what I need to put the time into increasing my aerobic capacity while contributing to the overarching objective.
