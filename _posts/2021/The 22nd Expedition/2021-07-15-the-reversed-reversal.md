Yes, I swore off Google. I then accepted my digital fate and plugged back in—only to pull away and ride out into the night leaving Google behind...to now find myself HERE, once again, making out shapes in the Google cloud. At the end of the day, while I can surely live without the vaulted Mountain View Behemoth, it just adds a lot of unnecessary work to the mix! The same logic could be applied to my basic take on electricity: yeah, I could adopt an Amish life where "we been spending most our lives / living in an Amish paradise" actually sounds APPEALING!  Think of all the DUMB stuff that's going on in the world right that is connected to the use of electricity! But, why do we go with that sweet, sweet juice? Life is easier. And it's why I cannot ultimately shelve Google.



And while you might think I might pick up my CD hobby again, or more specifically, my CD-to-FLAC hobby, I'm going to kill that project before I keep throwing money into something that eventually I'll recognize as a bunch of clutter and toss out (perhaps I'm more like Google than I care to admit, [Killed By Google](https://killedbygoogle.com/)), I will most definitely do that one day as I seek greater optimization, a throwback to a time when I was minimalist before minimalism was cool—yeah, I gotta give props, it's one of the few takeaways from millennials where they got it right!



While I do NOT like its interface, I like Google YouTube Music to play CDs from my favorite country singer, Garth Brooks or, chiefly, my 4-album collection of *Battlestar Galactica*. That said, I just found that the remastered versions of those albums are now on Spotify! In fact, even now I'm playing Season 2 and a couple of my favorites, *Pegasus* followed by *Something Dark is Coming*. Love it! Back in 2017  I actually purchased this very domain to create this site while being miffed AND listening to the *Colonial Anthem*. I once learned how to pick out the basic melody of *Kara's Coordinates* from Season 4 on a guitar—but, gosh, those few notes are THROUGHOUT the series! Finally, whenever I hear Wander My Friends, it reminds me of the relationship I had with my dad.



And now, I'm done with this digital medium stuff.  I'm going with Google.  It's time to shift my focus.
