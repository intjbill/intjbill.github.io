I hearken back to the time of 2020, when I spent countless hours at earning better gains, a pursuit that was far greater than the sweat equity invested at the gym, but expanded the palisades of my consciousness, that is, all that I know the world to be. Admittedly, we are remarkably finite creatures with limited knowledge of what goes around us and the myriad of interpersonal, concurrent connections at present state, the history thereof and its totality influence on the age that lies ahead.



I read books. A whole lot of of 'em. I organized my approach with three routes of identity as I tracked them via [Goodreads](https://www.goodreads.com), a context I maintained throughout the prior year and one I'm bringing back to 2021:



* **Blade Runner** - A tech and science-futurism focus along with the players' application that shape their use for power aggregation shaping the world toward a dystopian future.
* **Fitness Guru** - That which contributes toward superior versions of mind, body and soul. Because "*we just want to pump...(clap)...you up!*"
* **Entrepreneur** - The pursuit of value-added creations that (hopefully) doesn't tap to *Puttin' on the Ritz*.



I'm also adopting this schema as I make use of the free version of [Feedly](https://feedly.com/Feedly) as I bring more knowledge silos onto my farm. And while I continue to avoid news and sports medias, I'm still acquiring more information, even while present-day hysterics trickle down into my feed.



I've returned to my usage of [Todoist](https://todoist.com/). It's neither as fun as Habitica nor as community-driven as the MMORPG task app. Todoist functions as intended, a place to jot a note or two, adding things into my workflow.



That said, for all of my expansion, I've been reeling! I've been caught on the hook with krill oil supplements. While I first began taking 500 mg for joint pain, in recent days, I upped it to 1000 mg after reading a study. In the days that followed, I have been rendered to a state of apathy with never-ending nausea and a complete loss of appetite. The great thing about a carnivore diet is that it's pretty easy to run down issues when there's a change. It didn't take me long to suspect krill oil, though I shudder at stopping. I do want to get back to my daily training!



Nevertheless, what to do when I barely eat one day and dislike my Kerrygold coffee the next? I have no interest in fasting yet I have an extreme prejudice against ALL food! Of course, I don't have full knowledge of what ails me—perhaps, I am among *The Walking Dead*. As for now, I'm on the fence as to whether I'll completely cut out krill or if I'll return to the original 500 mg.
