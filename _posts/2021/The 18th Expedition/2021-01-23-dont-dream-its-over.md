As the clocked turned over into the New Year, I backed away from my returning to Facebook after years away.  I didn't write it off entirely, I even made a New Year's Resolution about my return for *next* New Year's. But in the words of Paula Cole, "I don't want to wait for our lives to be over." Therefore, I'm making my return to Facebook on 2/25 to kickoff The 19th Expedition.  It gives me enough time to be able to curate the experience and not just haphazardly whirl in there with a lot of sound and fury, but NO direction like a tornado through a trailer park.  

This is all a part or a larger narrative of not letting go of this fresh start's grip; I bristle at the very real prospect of falling off the mountain down into the valley of my average.  In that spirit, I'm pulling my New Year's Resolutions off the shelf—injuries and optimizations be damned—and taking an axe to that cursed shelf to add to the fire that burns across 2021.
