Admittedly, I didn't like yesterday's post.  The thing is, I *want* to believe that everyone in positions of power has the best of intentions, yet prisons are full of people whom had merely a taste of power—why should I throw an "aw shucks" blanket across everyone?  Clearly, politicians are not a higher standard of a person, why assume them to be as such? 

*I want to believe*; I don't want to be so cynical.  It's easy to quickly dismiss people, places, things and ideas; it's far harder to take a good, long look in the mirror and recognize our own weaknesses and threats.  But, it is critical that we do, for in practice, what else really matters but that which is within the sphere of our control?  We may shake our fist at our screens at news media reports, but what does it really matter when we are not in positions to affect the outcome?  How much better would it be to use that same energy toward our own situation?  

If we are not affecting change to those around us or to ourselves, perhaps, it's time to turn from the jumbotron and walk out of the arena.  Perhaps, this is the time  to hand in these ill-fitting robes as followers of celebrities and close the doors of our social media accounts.  Is the challenge of this age of humanity where instead of taking the leading role in our narrative, we just sit and watch someone else live their lives?  Not that I'd adhere to living in a vacuum devoid of any cabling—I like to be inspired!  But, at what point does our devotion become a replacement for *us*?  At what point does it become inspired demotivation?
