Yes, this post title seems to pull from an issue of DC Comics.  Life is just more of the same, whether elbow or knee injury.  Weirdly, I woke up this morning with a cramp on the calf of my injured knee, but I suspect it has something to do with my adding sodium and potassium 3 days ago to my diet as an experiment.  I had kicked both *No Salt* and salt out of my diet until recently and was fine without both.  Its reintroduction is a failed approach to resolve my right eyelid's twitching bouts; I'm left to believe that morning with the hot grease popping into my eye is ultimately to blame.

Plus, I'm led to believe that for me, salt consumption is an eating trigger / appetite agitator.

As to my appendage injuries, I'll have to blame me or how I respond to my ever-so-delightful carnivore diet with its ever-present reminder that January is WORLD CARNIVORE MONTH! 

So why do I say my response to my diet has shut me down?  It's made me feel *too* good and *too* powerful.  I went from hour strolls on the treadmill to EVERYTHING I do has to be about amping up the intensity!  It's not like it's a sudden start of physical activity, rather it's a sudden spike of intensity that has led my physical structure to be like, "Wait, wha?"  The thing is, I actually designed my program specifically for something to break, that if I couldn't work on my endurance with my legs, I could push it via my striking regimen.  But, I never figured out what to do if both systems are out—what's left? Flexing alternate pecs?  I remember reading about research that shows physial gains by just visualizing it.  At this point, that's all I've got left!
