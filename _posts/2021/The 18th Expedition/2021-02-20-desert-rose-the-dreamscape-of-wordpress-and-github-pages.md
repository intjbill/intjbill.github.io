In these recent weeks, I feel pulled toward two different outcomes, should I use WordPress on [NearlyFreeSpeech](https://www.nearlyfreespeech.net/) or hang out on [GitHub Pages](https://pages.github.com/)?  I know whenever something like this plagues me, it's never about the items themselves.  Like the interpretation of a dream, they are but elements on the stage. The thing is, I have yet to receive my Orphan Annie Secret Society decoder pin in the mail.

Like any good dream interpretation, let's at least snap these components into a context; what's my take on them?  WordPress is where I jam unaddressed letters into a rusty mailbox.  Despite my running Display Posts Shortcode, I just *feel* like the moment I write, they'll never be read again...well, read in the context of by humans and not all of these Cylons that jump in with their hot-to-the-touch FTL drives.  

While I try to invoke a level of humanity on my site by providing real-time data of songs played, does it really matter?  Do we *even* seek humanity anymore?  Or, do we just want beliefs confirmation?  People say they want friendship, but I suspect they just want identities of  ideality affirmation.  This is what the cascade failures of echo chambers with social media's hyperspace have wrought.  What does it matter *what* we say or shadow puppet?  

No one reads.  Just post a picture that can pass as identification to the gatekeeper.   Take your seat at the "popular" kids' lunch table. Now, repeat what everyone else says ad nauseum.  There's no creativity: it's just a copy-and-paste world. 

In this silent ocean context, do or do not update a WordPress install—individuals are inconsequential and meritless insofar as their contribution beyond crowdsourcing, trending data or whatever else the black box of Big Data's extrapolating interpolation prints out as  preacher's notes upon the lectern for a service with an infinite choir and not a single pew.

And then there is GitHub Pages.  How might I connote it?  Where does it fit through the lens of my dream interpretation?  GitHub is a place where people store creativity's child of handcrafted code while holding onto a faith in human connection for collaboration. To me, since the txt file journals I upload to GitHub don't become lost down a MySQL rabbit hole, they are real, as far as something digital *can* be real, anyway.  Instead of being another cog in the collective, each stands on its own.  I respect each post as such as I write, even though I generally fail to meet that criteria, for my head is in two worlds at once with WP and GH. I write for *me* with my GH site and I suspect that's the best approach when it comes to thoughtful journaling...it's not some sort of emotional vomit, but more of a meditative practice, different from other writing venues where there is a bit of a guessing game going on how we can best serve our principal audience.  

So back with the issue at hand, what is the better path?  As I ping pong between two choices, I recognize it has nothing to do with web hosting.
