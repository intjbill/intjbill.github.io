Bacon's gone.  That crisp, salty and fatty morsel of the gods is now, as of this 2nd day, OUT of my life—for now?  Oh, I KNOW, I hear my studio audience gasp! Believe me, I feel it over here...but my decision runs in line with what I like to do: experiment, pivot fast and stay agile (*Ocean's Thirteen* Slicing Hammer not included).  And with Bacon the Proper, so goes the bacon fat and its 10+ cups of Expeditionary intake.  

In the past, I relied on extra fat for further fuel and hunger satiation.  Today, I find Bacon unnecessary—YES, there was a time when Bacon was actually required, seriously...OK, admittedly it's hard to defend this, but you just *gotta* trust my stockroom of ethos on this one!  I needed Bacon fat for its fuel and satiety.  But the funny thing about Bacon is this: there's NO OFF SWITCH!  I feel the same thing about Kikkoman Soy Sauce on ANYTHING.  "You've got that stack of newspapers you want to recycle? Here, lemme palm heel a little bit on top."

So, salt could very well be the culprit and (not so much of a) SURPRISE: it has NOT been a part of my Carnivore Carnival Ride with the exception of that 3-day experiment the other day.

And honestly, my diet is all about the BEEF.  It powers me—well, OVERpowers me as I'm STILL reeling from my injuries from that latest compilation of Bill's *Greatest Hits of Intense Workouts*.  And the terrific thing about being a BEEFeater is when I'm full, I stop, not to mention that gig with the ravens over in London.
