While Spotify has helped to drive the success of The Expeditions as a container for its soundtracks, I am moving on from my reliance on both it and the general subscription model.  Whew, heady stuff, I know! The '90s called and **I** want my CD grove back!  And I could very well break from my playlist building archetype.  I want to concentrate on building my music library, like, what I actually own!  CRAZY, I know!

Long gone are those days where I once owned 800+ CDs.  But, I've got a armload now and they come pretty cheap these days.  I rip them to FLAC and also create a MP3 version to upload to YouTube Music for my mobility.  And with [Exact Audio Copy](https://www.exactaudiocopy.de), I can recover scratched up used CDs that are otherwise atrocious to listen to endure, like my recent rip of a favorite of mine, the Smashing Pumpkins' *Adore*.  After ripping them to FLAC, I'll create a MP3 version to upload to YouTube Music for my mobility.  I like [FlacSquisher](https://sourceforge.net/projects/flacsquisher/) for this purpose, but it could be anything.

Of course, this new approach won't cleanly enchant into all of my musical desires; everything has been so one-off single driven as opposed to the entire album.  For example, I never listen to one song from Pink Floyd.  I gotta listen to the entire *The Division Bell* album.  And yes, that CD is on my shopping list.  But, there are a whole slew of one-hit wonders or might-as-well-be one-hit-wonders.  As much as I like Howard Jones' *Things Can Only Get Better*, I doubt I'll ever own whatever album that came off of.  The same thing goes with Kavinsky's *Nightcall*, though the whole retrowave genre is problematic as it is a new, niche.  I *might* be able to find some limited run, new CDs, but I'm not interested in the sticker shock. 

Then there are my vinyls that I might have to buy CD versions—at least my Simon & Garfunkel, but Bruce, too.  While I know there are vinyl rips to FLAC out there, I'm disinterested in investing into the hardware for a one-time use.
