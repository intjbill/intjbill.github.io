## The Return to GitHub

It's back to San Francisco for me; I'm back on GitHub.  It's not entirely fair to Florida, I mean, WordPress is clunky—I knew *that*, you know *that*, EVERYBODY knows *that*!  I just forgot how bulky it just *feels*.  I look at all the code for a page of just text and ask myself, "Is ALL of *this* really necessary?"  It's a departure from a handful markup tags.  Honestly, throwing in a few p tags here and there isn't all that illegible or difficult—how have we evolved so much to have all of *THIS*?  It took me 5 minutes to find where a developer squirreled away the head tags!  I get it, though, looking through my worn frames of the complex is simple and the simple is complex.

Along with versioning and backups, I kinda just enjoy writing in markdown.  There's a simplicity to its transparency—beauty to it even!  And when I no longer desire to run a site, I've got all my files as text docs.

## The Beard Is Back!  And I Smell Great, Too!

As of 8 AM this morning, I reignite my beard, the last shave & trim for 2021!  As you'll recall, I thought I set aside my beard ambitions, but you know what?  I'm going after it.  The Beard must rule. The Yeard is coming.

And while I set aside deodorant with a cologne in its stead for the entire month, there was a day when I wore deodorant—but, that was more out of curiosity of cologne scented sticks.  I'm not missing it.  So, I'm returning to its removal as a thing.

## Coffee is Out—for Now

I just had the WORST late night experience with Coffee.  Coffee completely wrecked me...we just can't seem to make things work out.  Another day, my love.

## The Resolutions 

As we're Upon February's Eve, I'm going to re-examine the things I set aside on my Resolution list and will consider if I abandoned them too hastily and how I can shore up weaknesses in the others.

Lastly, upon February's Eve, will I be returning to Facebook on the 25th?
