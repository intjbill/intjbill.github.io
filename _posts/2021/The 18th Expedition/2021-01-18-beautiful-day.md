This morning, I again realized that I do not like coding at 4 AM.  Yes, I can use that space to go from 0-60, but that's a context where my body tells my brain, "Strap in and hang on because, partner, we're gonna go for a ride!"  But, without the motion of my cowboy hat wearin' body, well, my brain prefers to stay at rest.  Yes, I can look deep into the universe of a candle's flame or shroud my eyes and listen to binaural tones and reach out with my Jedi training, but coding...nope.  It's not that I didn't try!  The first week of this year was all about that.

I didn't do anything today, I know, you were thinking, "C'mon, Bill, with that song and everything?"  Well, it's like this:  it's about being at peace.  While I recognize I cannot currently work out like I did earlier, I'm OK with it and let it go.  And yes, I thought of replacing it by doubling down on my endurance until I realized that I don't need that either.  The cardio program I have will develop me.  While I like to gun my engines, less is more, especially guarding against future injuries.

In a few days, I'm going to cut back on my news consumption for all the reasons I've written before, namely, it's really never about my sphere and the perspectives are not healthy.  So with no context and no clue, I cast it aside.  Dark times are for those with no candle.
