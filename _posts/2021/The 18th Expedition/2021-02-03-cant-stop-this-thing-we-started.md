January was World Carnivore Month.  And while I wish I could claim this as my own, it's now Fiber Free February!  I intend to create more of these to fill out the rest of the year because...well, this sort of thing comes somewhat easily to me—you gotta be somewhat deft to pull off wordplay like this earlier post *Char Scores: the Rack of the Bones* in referencing the Star Wars title!

Bacon is back.  For a little over a week, I had no bacon or bacon fat in my diet.  I guess I wanted that sub-200 lb mark on the scale so badly that I fell back in that broken paradigm that calories mattered.  But, with the fat loss from my diet, I just haven't been as satisfied or energized.  We can't make lasting weightloss happen—directly anyway.  Instead, our body responds to our lifestyle;  our hormones determine our body composition.  It just happens.  I'll get to where I want in time, though admittedly it comes off a bit like being a kid longing for Christmas again!

Enough with the *why's* for BACON IS BACK!  I dunno if that can be understated.  It's bacon, people!  Gaffigan is completely on point:

This morning, I used my new [Instant Pot Duo 6-Quart](https://instantpot.com/portfolio-item/duo/) to cook my breakfast lb of ground beef.  All it needed was a cup of water and its trivet. After the pressurization, there was the 20 minute cook time and the depressurization. I then had a tasty plate of beef ready to go!  In the future, I might add another 3-5 minutes as I half-defrosted the meat instead of going straight frozen into the pot—life is an experiment!  Of course, this isn't the sort of browning application that I do on a hot skillet, but I suspect one that does a better job at retaining fat.
