As referenced a week ago, today is my rest day—yes, it has lost its zest since I shut upper body work down for this elbow.  Yet, I still want to do *something* for my MWF.  I'm now sporting an elbow sleeve and a desire for healing to put me back in the game.

In the meantime, what to do?  

Starting tomorrow for MWF, I'll replace Power training with Python learning. 

For M-F 4 AMs, I'm returning to meditation & visualization.

Of course, the TRS running regimen remains the same.

And while the rest of the world stays negative, I'm on a positive streak!
