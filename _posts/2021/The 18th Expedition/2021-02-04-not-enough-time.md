All day yesterday, I looked forward to this morning.  I set my FitBit alarm to *smart wake* by 3:45 AM.  I could choose among the dregs of my UFC subscription, the waning efforts of my YouTube TV trial or the chrono-tapestries of Spotify for some inspirational Coldplay.

After a couple of weeks away to nurse my injuries, I was ready to hit the treadmill. Wasn't I?

If I told you that the first song I listened to was Kenny G's off-chance cover of *You're Beautiful*...

...how did you think my morning went?

It was a DISASTER.  

The first 5 minutes were great. I was priming the pumps of digital content when I received my first omen: my recently updated iPad REFUSED to talk with my bluetooth-enabled stereo.  Sure, my android phone could, but...well, NO problem, I'll call an audible.  We've all got our inner Bill O'Reilly, right?

The iPad's speakers can hang with the machinations of a treadmill, something that cannot be said of my right knee some five minutes into a workout.  It began with a tightness behind the joint.  "No problem, lemme drop the incline down to 0%."  Then it felt...well, I can only describe it as the teenage angst of my patella as it glided along asphalt atop a skateboard while listening to the Smashing Pumpkins. *1979* all the way.  

So, I stopped, hobbled around my gym for a bit and pulled on my hand wraps and gloves.  There's nothing like a heavy bag routine to get the heart pumping! In just the first few strikes, my inner left elbow got a feeling—and NOT in a good *Hooked on a Feeling* kind of way!

It's the same feeling that *something isn't quite right while something isn't quite wrong*, either.  Just a feeling.  A spidey sense of an injury.

So, bagwork is out.  And there I stood: me and Kenny G.  

Spring is coming. And I can't put in the time for cardio to be ready for it.  But, who needs conditioning when you got [THIS!](https://open.spotify.com/track/13cpOnmccZGVGFngLxYN4I?si=bxpRZevHTJC15QBORhHiwg)
