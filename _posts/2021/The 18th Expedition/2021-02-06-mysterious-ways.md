At 42, I'm on my last cup with Coffee at this age.  You'll recall my relationship with Coffee [in an earlier post](/truly-truly/).  This departing embrace is a Starbucks French Roast from a french press.  In the upcoming days, will I miss that warm cup of insecticide to jump-start my mornings?

The 18th Expedition has been a bit of weird for me as I don't think I'm doing what I need to do. Or, should I say, what I want to do?  My training is on hold, I suppose—I mean, the smart play would be to lay off for the rest of the month and see if I heal up.  HOWEVER, I want to go after it!  Yesterday, in Part II of *Turning My Yard Into an Open Air Barn*, my time with spreading hay around the place contributed heavily to the 14,457 step total for the day.  So much for trying to simmer things down!

My diet has been all over the place, but not in bad way.  In The 17th Expedition, you'd set your clock to what I ate.  This time around, there's been a lot of variability.  I'm on-off with salt—the same with Coffee, and have been open to 3 lb beef days.  I even had a 6-egg omelet this morning using the leftovers from last night's beef roast!  

While I don't mind the added nutrition as my body heals, I bristle a bit with the time Coffee and me spend together.  See, the point of taking plants out of our rotation is to dodge their toxins, right, their innate ability for self-defense.  Yet, we get jollies from coffee BECAUSE of its defenses!

And I honestly, I don't know we're still a good fit.  I mean, at first the time I spend with Coffee is awesome, but as the time flies together, I have my misgivings.  And Coffee does give me acne...

...after this last cup, we're going to take a break from each other.   Maybe in July we'll see each other again, as my old summer playlist, [☀️ Sun Soaking 🍹](https://open.spotify.com/playlist/1AMpvlf7hCeyfal9qGSoND?si=Xktp3HuISU2GMqWM10SDug), plays on.
