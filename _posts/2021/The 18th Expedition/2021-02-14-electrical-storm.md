Last night, I spent 5 hours installing, securing, converting content, and theming a WordPress rendition of this site.  This morning, I rolled back the updates to this Jekyll and markdown furnishings in my home at GitHub.  I need to remind myself not to break my #7 New Year's Resolution: "Maintain My Website via GitHub Pages."  There's a reason why I felt it was a necessity for this year! 

Of course, this leaping between platforms is nothing new for me and I wrote about it considerably during 2020.  While I do like the Last.FM live status, there's nothing else that WordPress with its dynamic capability can provide me that I don't already have.  In fact, I realized last night that I just import the solutions I use for a static website into WP as opposed to using Just Another Aged Poorly Plugin.  And even with a cache solution, WP is a contestant running an obstacle course on *The Biggest Loser*.  

And I gotta admit, there's a little bit of personal pride that the theme is all mine—yes, of course the visual elements have been mine for several years as I've translated it into 3 different themes by other authors.  But, this time around, I just made a basic structure that makes it easy for me to know exactly what is going on. Jekyll makes it so that I can use a static layout with how I once used includes with php for templating, leaving an end result that—well, just check out the source code for this page—very readable!  Personally, I'd like to rework it a little bit as it relates to indenting, but I suppose it's not a critical thing for me to run down how the files come together as it relates to indents in the code, especially as it's an audience of one! (*And...well, considering I'm writing this in markdown, I don't really have to read it...nevertheless...*)

All that aside, I did consider sticking with WP, if it could provide me *something*, ANYTHING, that would make life better beyond letting you know what music that's playing right now (for the record, right now it's Live's [*All Over You*](https://open.spotify.com/track/7psAMS9VACNOP4kmPbRqXY?si=98455651acb944dd)).  So I googled...and grew sick to my stomach as I read how certain plugins can meet the needs of blogs to maximize the conversion ratio of its users...SMH.  I'm too old school for that.  Too human.  Why do people suddenly turn into used car salesmen when they are virtualized?  Why do they  think the endgame is about trying to trick people through "user content generation" to maximize the clickety-clack-clack tap dance?  Honestly, we will not notice when these people are replaced in society by Cylon models. I, for one, welcome our new Tricia Helfer overlords.
