Well, it's LIVE, my new design for 2021, making a clean break from the Retrowave of years past.  Of course, *new* in this context actually means *old*, though, honestly my newer Retrowave is based on the movement emulating the *older*, which was stylized on what might be *new*...oh NEVERMIND with tracking that thought pattern!  Welcome to my...*different* design.  And yes, it'll be *different* again soon, as this is just the initial release.  Then it'll be *old...er*.  

My hope is that I can achieve a direct approach for you, my friends.  It's far too easy, and this speaks to the entire web, to hide content either in plain sight or to pile it atop links atop links, deep down into the desk drawer next to that rattler of Tic Tacs.  Quick segue: do they still make breath spray?  I seemed to always keep one in my pocket around '93 and '94 before I upgraded to a thick packet of Piggly Wiggly purchased Winterfresh gum in '95 and '96.

I brought old content back to this site, everything that I know still exists...I've lost hundreds of posts over the years, but dwell on it I cannot! But in with the old, it's also in with the new!  I have plans for additional content with the image below as a kickoff.

As 2021 is the year for me to *Restore, Retrofit and Retrowave: Outrun the Night*, I thought it would be fun to do a monthly snapshot each 29th—can I still claim last year's Leap Day?  And while I moved on from The Yeard, it's not completely off my radar.  Once I achieve goal weight, I'd *love* to make another run.  Gotta beat that record of 8 months!
