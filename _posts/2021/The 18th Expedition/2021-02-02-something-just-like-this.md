Yesterday, I released my FINALIZED New Year's Resolution.  Almost.  Later that day, there was a final edit...OK, you got me, it was a version change.  While I loved the idea of all 10, I took 3 resolutions off the list.  While if I'm in a zone, I can do everything and more, I know I can't keep that sort of focus from today into 2022.  I wouldn't quite say the intentions are diametric—it's far more of an issue of resources.  The thing is, I keep trying to cram in things that are good and things I want to do, but, things can get out of hand.  Sure, I can listen to 240 audiobooks in a year—I've demonstrated in the past that I could have a 400-450 pace—but it does take a focused commitment to accomplish it.  And focus can be a fleeting thing when there's so much to look at.  Hence, let's reexamine my list and see how the focii don't compete but hopefully have some synergistic value:

| Rank 	| Focus 			| Resolution																														|
| --	| -- 				| -- 																															|
| 1		| Weight			|Reach 1st Year Anniversary of My Carnivore Diet on November 23, 2021.															|
| 2		| Fitness Outcome 	|Run in at Least Seven IRL 5Ks.																									|
| 3		| Education			|Learn Python and Build Programs to Track Fitness and Replace My Use of Gnucash.												|
| 4		| Friends			|Return to Facebook to Restore, Retrofit and Retrowave Our Lives After I've Been Years Away on a Sabbatical From Social Media.	|
| 5		| Fun				|**MANifest *The Yeard*** That Began on January 31, 8am. No Trimming Allowed, but Certainly Invite Boxes of Just for Men.				|
| 6    	| Discovery			|Explore Colognes as I Punt the Shampoo & Deodorant Construct.																|
| 7		| The Glue			|Maintain My Website via GitHub Pages.																							|

Is this scalable/adaptable for the future?  As I develop this focus schema, 2022 might have the same approach even with completely different resolutions.
