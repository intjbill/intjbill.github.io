The first month of 2021 is behind us.  We're past the prologue that framed our story's backdrop of 2020 with the potential of what lies ahead.  Today, we begin the first chapter.

As we experience this unique book, these are my finalized 2021 New Year Resolutions for February 1 - December 31, in order of priority:

1. Reach 1st Year Anniversary of My Carnivore Diet on November 23, 2021.
2. Run in at Least Seven IRL 5Ks.
3. Learn Python and Build a Program to Replace My Use of Gnucash.
4. Return to Facebook After My Years Away on My Sabbatical From Social Media.
5. Contribute Toward The Yeard That Began on January 31, 8am. No Trimming Allowed, but Certainly Invite Boxes of Just for Men.
6. No Deodorant or Shampoo as I Discover Colognes.
7. Maintain My Website via GitHub Pages.
