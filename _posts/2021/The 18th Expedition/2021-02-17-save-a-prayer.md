By the next time I've written, I hope I can say that I have had a successful test in bringing my legs online for 5K training. Since shutting everything down, I don't know where I'm at—there's been an absence of any pain for the last couple of days, so that tells me I'm good, right?

The tight and pain irritation in my left shoulder remains along with the dinged elbow on that side, so my bag gloves will remain on the shelf…

Of course, there's that little thing about hours spent in a space with ice on the inside of the windows, but…how better can I give tribute to the BEST training montage of ALL-TIME, [*Rocky IV*](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B_9FyTiq3SA)? It's not like I've chosen to actually run up my snow-covered hill here and take an axe to one of these trees—I did think about it!

OK, to be fair, I think I prefer the snap of [*Rocky III*'s montage](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iYvJrlgVaRE&t=1s)...and at this point I prefer its beach.
