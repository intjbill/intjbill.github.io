Once again: *Happy World Carnivore Month*! In a context of a very predictable menu, I've called an audible: along with my day-to-day beef & bacon, for today only, I tried eating a hard-boiled egg WHOLE.  Yep, shell and everything!  And you know what?  I was justified in my lifelong dislike for hard-boiled eggs!  The shell was...entertaining: it was like a little bit over-the-top, FAR TOO CRUNCHY, candy coating.  Overall, I was reminded how I've disliked eggs entirely until my first time with those succulent omelets in college.  They were western omelets at places like Perkins and Blue Plate Cafe.  HOWEVER, a hard-boiled egg is...disappointing. Brings me back to junior high chef salads. *\*violent bristle\**

As I write this, I'm drinking a broth from chicken back, hoping to absorb all of its collagen goodness!  It's an inviting cup and a different flavor as I've been so bacon & beef centric. 

So, what's the deal, Bill?  Well, I'm nursing an injured elbow, one that I really don't know if I picked up via that pop as I was tearing down the deck or did I knock myself out with my striking routine?  I've always felt that my elbows were indestructible weapons of destruction, but as my wife reminded me, I think I'm 21 when I'm 42!  Oh, entropy!  Nevertheless, as the Bryan Adams song goes, 

> 18 'til I die, 18 'til I die    
> It sure feels good to be alive    
> Someday I'll be 18 goin' on 55    

I tried to back off my elbow usage by canceling my tricep resistance...then it was my Arnold presses...then I took out all of my lifting...then it was my MaxiCimber...and finally, I took out my striking routine.  Frankly, I suppose the whole MWF program is gutted now.  Or is it?  I don't know what it'll shape into now...so far the ideas I've had involve my arms.  Of course, TRS is fine as its just 5K training.  I was thinking about reallocating my mornings for Python or meditation and I still might.  I just *really* wanted to work on my definition as I continue to drop weight.

Admittedly, when I realized I had to pause my power training, it bummed me out.  I hope to return to it later this year.  That said, I can now better focus on running and again, never to be discounted, my desire to be a Python programmer this year.  It's one of those goals that just seem to slip out of my fingers year after year, but this time, things are different; I am different, because as Bryan Adams sings:

> Don't worry about the future    
> Forget about the past    
> We're gonna have a ball, yeah    
> Gonna have a blast, we'll make it last
