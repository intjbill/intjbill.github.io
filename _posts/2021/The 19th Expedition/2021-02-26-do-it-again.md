In the past, I would have walked away. I would have made a sweeping motion with my hands and dismissed my weightloss efforts entirely. I'd cannonball into a vat of nachos as the months fell off the calendar. I did that 4 times through The Expeditions. What did I learn? Junk food is the discarded memories of a junkyard.

Yes, the scale was a disappointment; these injuries through The 18th were a disappointment; this swollen left foot with its inability to bear weight is a disappointment! I cannot underscore enough how defeating it is to wake up last night at 1AM with a foot pain that would not subside enough for me to fall asleep again until after 2 ½ hours and a couple of Extra Strength Tylenol.



I refuse to quit: I'm losing weight. I have <em>no</em> idea how I'm going to hit my goal to run in seven 5K's this year when right now I flail after my crutches. I could have ended it here; I didn't have to restart the clock with The 19th. I could have quietly released this website into the ocean depths of the Internet. But, I choose to <em>do it again</em>.
