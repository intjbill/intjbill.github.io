After researching within the field of orthopedics, I am fairly certain that I have an ACL injury and considering that only a minority of these injuries are partial tears which will typically develop into completely torn, I probably have a torn ACL.

Considering that torn ACL injuries are unable to heal on their own and total costs of replacement surgery is $10-$15k which is steep for someone who does not have health insurance and is getting paid 35% less than what the market pays for the position, it looks as though it is the end of another era for me.

I used to regard my right leg as strength of mine; I would jump off of it with layups in basketball and considered it my primary leg in throwing 1000's of kicks in Taekwondo.

Someone may object and say "Bill you are no doctor, how can you possibly know what you're talking about?" Don't you hate those kinds of people who for whatever reason have been prohibited from thinking upon their own so that they must be spoon-fed what they know and lack the capacity to learn on their own faculties. Do they even have a glimmer of independent thought? True, I may have misdiagnosed the issue for within the realm of IT, I have misdiagnosed plenty of issues so it is certainly conceivable that I am wrong. I do know that I seemingly enough exhibit the symptoms of the injury and am daily plagued by knee instability. For the past two days I have fallen from it.

There's a whole host of issues I can address from the perspective of this new era and as time and motivation permits, hopefully I will be delving into those matters in these journals. Overall, I think the issues all revolve around strength.

On a happier note, as I composed this journal, I was given a 9% raise.
