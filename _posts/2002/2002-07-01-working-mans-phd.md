All right, perhaps Aaron Tippin's blue collar classic is not addressing your run-of-the-mill network administrator. But then again, I am not your run-of-the-mill network administrator. Of course, the argument could be made questioning its validity for personal application because, frankly, when do I sweat in breezy 67 degree serverroom / office? I sweat when the network crashes. I think it applies with the overall theme of working hard with pride and competency.

But regardless to all of such seesawing banter, I did not choose these lyrics to describe my end user management work ethic. In my aggressive pursuit to bring to a close all of my debts and put myself in a fluid position for the future, I am closer to acquiring a second job. I am considering on a schedule that will add an additional 28 work hours to my schedule which will bring the tally of total hours at work to 58. If my methodologies prove fruitful and my calculations are correct, I should be able to wipe out $4,000 of credit card debt in three months.

Unless I take upon more desirable opportunities, I do not foresee moving out during the next 3 months for financial reasons, though I do yearn to do so. Halloween is turning out to be a bigger date than I had initially planned in reaching my weight of 170.
