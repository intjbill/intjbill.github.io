There are times when one floats through his day full of joy and contentment, where the world seems "right" and the promise of an even a "brighter" tomorrow is within a moment's grasp.

The past few weeks I have embraced this remarkable perspective upon my walk of life. Yet, those lovely things came to a shuddering halt. Today is not one of those blissful days. I do not perceive love's renewed entrance within the near future.

No, I find myself in the place which has long since become worn for me. It is a familiar place and like a stone from a riverbed, it is worn smooth with the passage of time and in its holding attributes of the bland, it has no jagged edges, nothing that would be unexpected, for even the unexpected is expected.

We pursue what seemingly enough cannot be won by our own merits.
