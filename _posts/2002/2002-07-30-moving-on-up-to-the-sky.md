It has been several days since I've updated my log entries. As in many things in life, time seeps from our grasping hands like sand. The Sands of Time. I suppose it is an overdone analogy. Regardless, I believe this is the first time I have made the comparison in written word. But who am I to tromp through everyone else's thoughts?

During this time of "journal silence", an opportunity arose for me to move out with a couple of guys in my accountability / fellowship / bible study group, Nic Winn and John Cook. It would have provided the possibility of greater spiritual growth and though it required some planning, it was economically feasible for me to pursue. I began to move in that direction and prepared accordingly. Though he offered a couple reasons so that he could alleviate himself, one of the guys felt that he would be unable to live with two roommates. I found it a little frustrating since I had already moved in that direction with them. In retrospect, I am glad the cookie crumbled.

I am planning to move into my own place within the next few months if I can bring in either a secondary source of income or have the primary source increased. With grad school on the horizon along with goals of debt reduction, I am finding myself a little cash-strapped.
