This morning as I swept through the muck of Monday morning's rush hour traffic, the focus of my thoughts fell upon those applying their false faces during our joint march to employment.

Those who pursue this application of a false face are more than those who applying makeup during this drive in their attempt to hide the attributes of their "social imperfection of beauty" so that they may gain favor merely on a false attractiveness, but also include those poor souls who use the drive from home as a buffer so that can slide on their "How are you doing? I'm fine" mask with no regards to whether they are dying on the inside if not already dead. Surely, we were not meant to be so shallow, so superficial.

As I continued down the road of many, I considered the popular music of our culture that does not dare to dive into the depths of human existence, rather merely wets the appetite of the "false faces" to satisfy their insatiable desire for social acceptance. Of course, there would be no market if there was no demand.

As a Psychology professor pointed out to me long ago, we as people are not lions, rather we are sheep. If I may continue with the analogy: sheep which seemingly enough are like lemmings, plunging by the thousands to the depths below.
