I'm doing ok for myself. Today, I threw several hundred bucks in my check account and have over a hundred in my wallet. True, in a matter of a couple weeks I'll find myself squirreling around for change and I'll have single digits in my bank account, but as of today, I gotta admit, I'm sitting pretty. It's a good place to be. I'm no closer to running off out West in a VW van, but events as such should go largely unplanned.

Jeremy gave me some really good news today. Of course, I am not one who spends time counting his chickens before they run around with their heads cut off, but I should find myself in an IT position that will give me more financial freedom, a great benefits package (including PT tuition), job security, and career enhancement. Out of the 75 applicants that filtered through the initial HR screening (I suppose the total count could be doubled that of who passed), I was chosen among 5 candidates that were interviewed for a position supporting the 70 computer labs on U of M's campus. Due in large part because of Jeremy's recommendation, after the interview my name was given to HR to be hired. There are some administrative checks that must be completed before its final, but it is seemingly enough coming together quite nicely. But, I am making sure I keep the "worst case scenario" mindset at the forefront of my thoughts.

It is hard not to feel giddy. I suppose another perspective I should take is enjoy the time where I'm at and let tomorrow be tomorrow instead of today. Once again, balance is the key. Enjoy the freedom, but do not overextend and get beat.

Yet, I am not looking forward to giving in my two weeks notice to Craig, my boss at Germantown Baptist. He has been a really great boss. I hate leaving all of the IT Support on his shoulders again since it is just the two of us. The environment at GBC has been good with respect to both systems and people.

GBC *did* have the opportunity to give me full time status back in September, but three and a half months later there has been nothing. Due to budget constraints, apparently it was decided that GBC does not desire to meet the benefits required by state law. Craig did campaign for my cause, but the building annexation has a throat hold upon the resources of the church and I am too expensive. Without the full time status upgrade, it has been just a matter of time before I would find employment elsewhere and seemingly enough the time has arrived.
