Specialization is integral in our lives, but specialization with a focus on balance is the key.

I brought to a close a poem that I have been influenced to write entitled "My Rose". It is a piece that is rich in symbolism. As soon as I finished the final pen strokes, I knew I had hit a homerun with it. There is even a reference to a Simon and Garfunkel song in it, though I doubt that even Paul Simon would find it.

I came into work today at 8:30 and the front secretary told me the one thing an IT person does not want to hear when they first come to work: "a lot of people want to see you." Not a good sign considering that most of the users were there since 8am and since my boss is still out to recoup after the surgery, there was no one else for support. Early on, I only heard symptoms of the issue, but essentially they all dealt with losing or not having network access, though it did not affect all users. After a little troubleshooting, fifteen minutes later, I had rerouted all the users on a flaky hub to the backup hub. It was a GREAT feeling to resolve this issue. This has been my first corporate-setting, network crash, much less I was the only one here that could do anything about it. During the crisis at one point, I cut off a user prematurely because she was giving me redundant/irrelevant data and I needed speed. I do feel a little regret from doing so though it was justified.
