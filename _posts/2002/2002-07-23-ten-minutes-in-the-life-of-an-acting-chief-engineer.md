As I walked the lower decks of GBC, I felt as though I was upon a galaxy class starship.

The air system gave an auditory ambience analogous to the 1701-D's and in my hurried pace to my next task, I felt as though one of the Enterprise's crewman driven with purpose. I nodded to a couple passing "aliens" who doddled about, seemingly overwhelmed by the environment before them. I entered the turbolift and reached the upper deck.

As I type these thoughts, our pastor of assimilation (honestly, that's the title) walked past my office and said the words "...in a little bit, I'm going to be McGruff the Crime Dog". Those crafty Borg.
