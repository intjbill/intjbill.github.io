Our Exchange server (email) is back up at GBC and I'm glad yesterday is over. I solved my first issue yesterday and I was pretty gleeful over myself because it dealt with our main database that I'm not a fan of supporting. But, I found myself unable to resolve everything thereafter. I felt inept... quirky file issues over the network, an upper-end deskjet that won't stay powered on because part of the packing Styrofoam was broken deep within the printer while I was removing it, a screwy app installation on my boss's own system... I seemingly enough could not do anything right. It was just a day that lingers into the night like a bad taste. I stopped by the Mug and treated myself to a Raspberry Chai with a shot of caramel.

Anyway, I hope today fares better- so far it has anyway. Last night as Brownie, John and myself were in the living room and Padgett and Nic were out on the street talking, I heard someone take about 8-9 shots in rapid succession behind our house. It felt really close, but I guess it was just the street behind our house. I went in our backyard with Padgett and Nic behind me as I had my gun drawn but I didn't see/hear anything.

Yep... just 10 months to go! City living sure beats the suburbs! =)
