<em>A hand to hold,<br/>
A kite to share,<br/>
And dances in the rain.</em><br/>
<br/>
Pure eyes that sparkle deep blue;<br/>
Gentle cheeks of a soft hue;<br/>
Flowing hair masking her face;<br/>
Soft hands find books to embrace;<br/>
Warm lips of invitation,<br/>
Pursed in deep concentration...<br/>
<br/>
Dreaming upon these visions,<br/>
One's heart will leap needlessly.<br/>
The hope of shared emotions,<br/>
Fades in mists of misery.<br/>
<br/>
Groaning all pains in a sign,<br/>
These events unfold once more.<br/>
With a heavy breath, I cry:<br/>
&quot;I can't do it anymore.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
On this walk in want for love,<br/>
One is marred by tragedy.<br/>
Failed expectations thereof,<br/>
Prove one's fallibility.<br/>
<br/>
Within the whirl of mind,<br/>
There's a soulache of the lonely.<br/>
With these times that seem unkind,<br/>
Why have You forsaken me?<br/>
<br/>
Yet through one's perseverance,<br/>
The strength of character soars.<br/>
Thus hope gains more prominence,<br/>
And in one's heart, His love pours.<br/>
