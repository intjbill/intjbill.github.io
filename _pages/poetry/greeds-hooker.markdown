<div class="poetry">
You say hills of God are thousand cattl'd,<br/>
Yet you slither, your palm's rouged face unveiled.<br/>
<br/>
You say you're homeless; you're a visitor,<br/>
Yet you enchant your bordello with myrrh.<br/>
<br/>
You say you're secured with eternal life,<br/>
Yet a flimsy match would scorch this whored wife.<br/>
<br/>
You say loved money: a root of evil,<br/>
Yet you're thrilled with your bastard, fiscal fill.<br/>
<br/>
You say seek things first the kingdom of God,<br/>
Yet lie with the Devil's dowry'd facade.<br/>
<br/>
O you of damned delight!<br/>
You lurk 'neath the shadows of pews<br/>
Peddling your poisoned Amway'd ooze.<br/>
<br/>
O you of the red light!<br/>
The &quot;hallowed&quot; enemy within <br/>
Outbids the enemy in &quot;sin.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
O you of the sold night!<br/>
Your servant eyes of the serpent<br/>
Glimmer cold for all that is gold.<br/>
