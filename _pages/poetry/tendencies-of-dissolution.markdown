<div class="poetry">
A slave to my own lustful desires<br/>
A lackey to what destroys me<br/>
The dangers of youth comprise many<br/>
Wisdom flows through very few<br/>
Destruction can be set at every turn<br/>
Choices now impact tomorrow's option<br/>
What's molded today shapes tomorrow<br/>
<br/>
I don't even know who I am anymore.<br/>
You don't even know who I am anymore.<br/>
I am so different now only if you could see.<br/>
Darkness is a part of me. Light has evaded me.<br/>
<br/>
A shot rings out at night. A light flickers out.<br/>
Hope finally dies. Dreams end with a crash.<br/>
<br/>
