<div class="poetry">
Renouncing the gatekeeper,<br/>
He passes by its edict.<br/>
Long was he his own captor<br/>
Removed from his soul's frolic.<br/>
<br/>
Unknown self-imprisonment<br/>
Came bundled with his skillset.<br/>
An ill-considered judgement<br/>
Shackled the years with regret.<br/>
<br/>
That which had owned mastery<br/>
Fades from eyes that see again.<br/>
The edict of the entry<br/>
Is lost on ears that listen.<br/>
<br/>
Beyond the corral's fenced gate,<br/>
He winds the path's liturgy.<br/>
An old trail of unknown fate<br/>
Melts 'neath a tree'd canopy.<br/>
<br/>
Forests of the infinite<br/>
Contrast to metered enclaves.<br/>
Though brush impedes his transit,<br/>
Life exceeds the dens for slaves.<br/>
