<div class="poetry">
the report of the clickety-clack of the 102<br/>
matches the rapid firing of the well-scorned.<br/>
this match does not light<br/>
but resigns to require this retreat of the recluse:<br/>
TO HOWL AT THE HEAVENS ON HIGH!<br/>
TO BELLOW TO THE BOWLS BELOW!<br/>
<br/>
[To you]<br/>
I expressively expound at the expanse exacted<br/>
betwixt extremes...<br/>
I am...unheard<br/>
<br/>
I AM: a mute MIME at the SCHOOL for the BLIND.<br/>
I AM: a spring BREEZE at a HEIGHT beyond TREES.<br/>
I AM: a sealed ROSE beyond GLASS at a FLOR'S'.<br/>
I AM: a drenched CUP of clenched RAIN for the QUENCHED.<br/>
<br/>
a haggard man upon a<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;downward-downtown<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;street:<br/>
<br/>
I am veiled by wild gesticulation<br/>
hands tied by nonsensical articulation<br/>
<br/>
&quot;Come my partner, my dancing squirrel!<br/>
Fly and show me your freedom.<br/>
Come my good time, my playful robin!&quot;<br/>
<br/>
I sing; I shout.<br/>
<br/>
[To me]<br/>
no eyes to hear<br/>
no ears to see<br/>
<br/>
you refuse my rants<br/>
you walk across<br/>
to drink...or drunk (for I never know)<br/>
from the bag lady<br/>
<br/>
see how her cart clinks!
