<div class="poetry">
Roaming their realms of darkness,<br/>
Foreboding masses appear.<br/>
Dumping their wet misery,<br/>
Friends turned fiends do burden me.<br/>
<br/>
Falling tumults of water<br/>
Ended the times of banter.<br/>
The night of inundation,<br/>
Closed the growing connection.<br/>
<br/>
Upon another wet night,<br/>
Time apart was the shared plight.<br/>
Falling precipitation<br/>
Increased the introspection.<br/>
<br/>
Contrary to those past thoughts,<br/>
Union left unresolved droughts.<br/>
In the downward departure,<br/>
Winds were of a dank nature.<br/>
