<div class="poetry">
In a world composed of glass,<br/>
Her home is for all to see—<br/>
A mockery to the sea.<br/>
<br/>
Within this reality,<br/>
She sees no originality.<br/>
For locked under scrutiny,<br/>
Life is for the dying.<br/>
<br/>
Days are as the one before;<br/>
It's life within plastic weeds.<br/>
The wax and wane of the lights,<br/>
Drops the daily manna.<br/>
<br/>
