<div class="poetry">
Within the amber lamplight,<br/>
Strange faces pass in a blur.<br/>
He stumbles into the night<br/>
And talks alone with a slur.<br/>
<br/>
Choosing to run through her life,<br/>
The bottle masks discontent.<br/>
Yet, there still remains the strife:<br/>
Passion now inanimate.<br/>
<br/>
Under the gloom of the moon,<br/>
The drink did not slay the pain.<br/>
As the clock ticked the night's noon,<br/>
His angst she did not contain.<br/>
<br/>
In his soliloquy's rage,<br/>
A fool's lament finds no fruit.<br/>
If he could just turn the page,<br/>
Life would arise from the soot.<br/>
<br/>
His locks are his to open,<br/>
Yet, he chooses to remain.<br/>
She beckons from where I've been,<br/>
But, I turn in my refrain.<br/>
<br/>
