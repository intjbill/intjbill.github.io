<div class="poetry">
Traversed roads of loneliness<br/>
Prove as a poor companion.<br/>
Shrouded in the mind's darkness,<br/>
Moods lurk toward destruction.<br/>
<br/>
Gravitation to this plight,<br/>
One seeks joyless contentment.<br/>
How pitiful is this sight<br/>
Of one's pain and resentment.<br/>
<br/>
For such self-serving sorrow,<br/>
Proves to serve no man at all.<br/>
Seeking solace in a foe<br/>
Who sets up one for a fall.<br/>
