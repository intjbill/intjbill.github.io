<br/>
I lay at night<br/>
<br/>
the disjointed harmony<br/>
of a symphony of imps<br/>
clamor with instruments<br/>
crafted from the ore<br/>
of subjugated satiation<br/>
<br/>
those metals are mined<br/>
from and for<br/>
a mitigated mind,<br/>
shaped from invitation for invitation,<br/>
fed by a beetle's prattle<br/>
to a kangaroo's pram<br/>
<br/>
systemic or inherent,<br/>
appetites are gorged:<br/>
<br/>
a seedless chase of the pursuit to feel alive<br/>
whatever that life is, if a life at all<br/>
<br/>
I struggle in this consumption of the dead.<br/>
<br/>
—it is not the repulsion that repulses;<br/>
the dead is engineered<br/>
with an otherworldly, witches' brew<br/>
to entice and satiate<br/>
the mitigated mind<br/>
<br/>
on the left<br/>
and on the right,<br/>
there I watch the dead...<br/>
<br/>
chortle<br/>
and<br/>
gurgle<br/>
and<br/>
guttural chomp<br/>
<br/>
...through the trough of selected tendons and nerves<br/>
<br/>
familiar writs and wrists turn upward<br/>
as I see the hands of a corpse<br/>
grasping the sinews of subjugated satiation<br/>
<br/>
