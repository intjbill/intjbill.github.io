Champion versus loser:<br/>
The composition of me.<br/>
A strong, righteous warrior,<br/>
Against one of vanity.<br/>
<br/>
With the clash of such contrast<br/>
The inner struggles ensue.<br/>
The victories of the past<br/>
Reap the crop of what is due.<br/>
<br/>
The light of truth and honor<br/>
Illuminates life's journey.<br/>
A just life fuels the fire,<br/>
Of a man being happy.<br/>
<br/>
How tempting is the dark side!—<br/>
For the vices count many.<br/>
Carnal pleasures lurk inside<br/>
This hole of depravity.<br/>
<br/>
How curious is this fight<br/>
Between Death and Majesty.<br/>
But the choice remains despite<br/>
Its ponderous irony.<br/>
<br/>
Although death is predestined,<br/>
The choice of sin presses on—<br/>
Temptin me until the end,<br/>
In Him, I rely upon.<br/>
