<div class="poetry">
Passing pavement for his meal,<br/>
He lost his identity.<br/>
Blank behind his big rig's wheel,<br/>
He runs from eternity.<br/>
<br/>
The beckoning of the call<br/>
Pains him beyond admission.<br/>
In his escape from the fall,<br/>
He's found in drug possession.<br/>
<br/>
All caught on television,<br/>
He crumbles for all to see.<br/>
&quot;What a fool!&quot; cries the man's son;<br/>
A son whose life is TV.<br/>
<br/>
Shackled by a vocation,<br/>
The son seeks sitcoms' solace.<br/>
Hours of fabrication,<br/>
Still reflects the mirrored face.<br/>
<br/>
The beckoning of the call<br/>
Is the yoke in which we heave.<br/>
Thoughts on the point of it all<br/>
Weigh upon what we believe.<br/>
<br/>
