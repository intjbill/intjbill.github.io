<div class="poetry">
Enveloping the night's air<br/>
Coldness permeates my soul.<br/>
Facing winter in despair,<br/>
I can't fill this empty hole.<br/>
<br/>
In this realm of solitude,<br/>
Longing for someone so dear,<br/>
I exist in lonesome mood<br/>
While she is nowhere near.<br/>
<br/>
Vastness of space separates<br/>
The one of beauty from me.<br/>
Is my life ruled by the Fates,<br/>
Like a sad, Greek tragedy?<br/>
<br/>
I am left to live alone.<br/>
Pain, heartache, and loneliness<br/>
Are what I claim as my own.<br/>
<br/>
