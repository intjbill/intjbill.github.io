<div class="poetry">
Though weary of loneliness,<br/>
I loathed near frivolity:<br/>
Wanton acts of uselessness,<br/>
Unappealing gaiety.<br/>
<br/>
Though the world strives for balance,<br/>
There is inequality.<br/>
Such has little, true substance—<br/>
A life of futility.<br/>
<br/>
What a dismal existence,<br/>
This view of depravity!<br/>
Just a self-serving pittance—<br/>
An outlook of vanity.<br/>
<br/>
How deplorable is one,<br/>
Who turns form the Almighty.<br/>
Yet, redemption through the Son,<br/>
Cleanses past debauchery.<br/>
<br/>
