<div class="poetry">
As the temperature drops<br/>
And the days go by,<br/>
Gust of ice winds,<br/>
Blast our past warmth goodbye.<br/>
<br/>
Under the gray sky<br/>
Of January,<br/>
My heart longs for,<br/>
Your company.<br/>
<br/>
Apart from your soft personality,<br/>
Winds of once kinder themes<br/>
Blow presently with freezing force;<br/>
Thus warm memories are vague dreams.<br/>
<br/>
Though alone amongst the airstreams,<br/>
I think upon the future.<br/>
For permeating chills do not shackle<br/>
Envisioned days of sweeter allure.<br/>
<br/>
