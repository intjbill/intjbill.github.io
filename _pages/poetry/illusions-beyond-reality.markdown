<div class="poetry">
The heart longs for true company<br/>
For neither shallow appearance,<br/>
Nor dating games of agony,<br/>
Can replace that of true substance.<br/>
<br/>
How many times has one engaged<br/>
In these pursuits of vanity?<br/>
The passionate heart is enraged<br/>
From one's insensitivity.<br/>
<br/>
So where is the resolution?<br/>
When will one find true contentment?<br/>
Is love more than an illusion?<br/>
Do all end with disappointment?<br/>
<br/>
Though one treads on to live alone,<br/>
There has to be more than this fate.<br/>
Though her name has yet to be shown,<br/>
One deeply yearns for his soul mate.<br/>
