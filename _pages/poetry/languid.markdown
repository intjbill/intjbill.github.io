<div class="poetry">
I flow with the ebb of the world<br/>
Solid images are merely components of clouds<br/>
An appearance with non-existence<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;fragments of illusion<br/>
What appears to be, is only what one can see<br/>
Images once true, flow through my vision<br/>
My sight, lost within the flux<br/>
Fades into realms of unreality<br/>
<br/>
