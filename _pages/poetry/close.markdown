<div class="poetry">
Countless times I've looked upon<br/>
The northeastern horizon.<br/>
Though not knowing why I scanned,<br/>
I sought the warmth of her hand.<br/>
<br/>
If I close my eyes<br/>
Will it be no more?<br/>
If I close my eyes<br/>
Will she love once more?<br/>
<br/>
On nights of dissolution<br/>
And days of resolution,<br/>
I had eyes of a gazer<br/>
For that which is no longer.<br/>
<br/>
If I close my eyes<br/>
Will it be no more?<br/>
If I close my eyes<br/>
Will she love once more?<br/>
<br/>
Thinking upon her brown eyes,<br/>
I searched those forbidden skies,<br/>
Thus, I pushed out aimlessly<br/>
In self-contained misery.<br/>
<br/>
Would she search to see<br/>
If absent was he?<br/>
Perhaps she would be...<br/>
...Similar to me.<br/>
<br/>
I close my eyes.<br/>
