<div class="poetry">
Pushing the boundaries of life,<br/>
I define a new existence.<br/>
Proving all of the doubters wrong,<br/>
I am heading out there tonight.<br/>
<br/>
On the road to nowhere 'round here,<br/>
I am upon life's horizon.<br/>
Faster and higher than I've known,<br/>
None can end such a flight of mine.<br/>
<br/>
With life's invasion of dreams,<br/>
I wake from this sweet slumber.<br/>
For what is known, as it seems,<br/>
Is a dictated stupor.<br/>
<br/>
Why do I choose to adhere<br/>
To that of no desire?<br/>
What quencher could be drawn near<br/>
That quells this raging fire?<br/>
<br/>
Shattering the barrier,<br/>
I soar above my soul's heights.<br/>
Flying faster and higher,<br/>
I ever yearn for such flights.<br/>
<br/>
