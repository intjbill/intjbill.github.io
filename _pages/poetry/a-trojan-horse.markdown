What a grand gift to receive,<br/>
This equestrian figure!<br/>
An entity few conceive,<br/>
With much appeal and allure.<br/>
<br/>
Awed by its magnificence,<br/>
Its grandeur charmed a young boy.<br/>
He pledged for the beast's defense—<br/>
His sword just a wooden toy.<br/>
<br/>
In games of heroic play,<br/>
The boy defended with flair.<br/>
Soft moods share the carefree day,<br/>
Yet, changes were in the air.<br/>
<br/>
With the day's death by night,<br/>
A door's long creak unleashed hell.<br/>
Unfurled in strength and might,<br/>
Came death's fury; the boy fell.<br/>
