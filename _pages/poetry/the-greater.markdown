<em>&quot;The Lust of the Flesh,<br/>
The Lust of the Eyes,<br/>
And the Pride of Life.&quot;</em><br/>
<br/>
In the curve of a smile,<br/>
A gaze turns to a poised sting.<br/>
But I choose the lone mile,<br/>
To seek the life of the King.<br/>
<br/>
To own wealth, I will provide.<br/>
To truly be, I must die.<br/>
To be great, I drop my pride.<br/>
To become low is to fly.<br/>
<br/>
Encircled by enticement,<br/>
I see it as foolishness.<br/>
For the Beauty that was sent,<br/>
Surpasses that muck of less.<br/>
