<div class="poetry">
In the bliss of the morning,<br/>
Dew glistened upon my rose;<br/>
Petals were wide embracing<br/>
The day as the sun arose.<br/>
<br/>
Stretching within the day's light,<br/>
Simple joys are for my rose.<br/>
No turbulence within sight:<br/>
An oath of bright tomorrows.<br/>
<br/>
Gentle touches of the wind<br/>
Sway the petals of my rose.<br/>
Yet the wind does not offend<br/>
The fluttering of sparrows.<br/>
<br/>
As the last light glowed faintly,<br/>
Whips of wind shuddered my rose.<br/>
The storms poured wet misery—<br/>
The sparrows—now cackling crows!<br/>
<br/>
What had once been a soft sight<br/>
Is pessimistic morose.<br/>
What once was tender delight<br/>
Now holds true to a false pose.<br/>
<br/>
My rose is morose.<br/>
Morose is my rose.<br/>
