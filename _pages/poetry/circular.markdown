<div class="poetry">
Dreams show their intangibility;<br/>
The oppressor lights its morn.<br/>
Long have I known<br/>
Promises that vanish in the morning.<br/>
<br/>
The steps I've known<br/>
Are the steps I've taken.<br/>
The steps of ago<br/>
Do trouble me.<br/>
<br/>
For I look upon the coming path<br/>
And view my own steps:<br/>
The steps of days gone by,<br/>
The steps of the heart's affliction.<br/>
<br/>
Upon a journey of burden,<br/>
There exists none other.<br/>
Though I yearn for the key,<br/>
I remain in shackles.<br/>
<br/>
