<div class="poetry">
The galloping, steel stallion,<br/>
Presses onward through the night.<br/>
Despite the ride's frenzied pace,<br/>
What exists will be no more.<br/>
<br/>
Though their time was spent in joy,<br/>
Alone, his mood is somber.<br/>
Passing the deadened storefronts,<br/>
The winds of change nip his heels.<br/>
<br/>
Months bygone presented plots,<br/>
Once fresh, now are retrospect.<br/>
Gazing back with a keen eye,<br/>
I see His hand in it all.<br/>
<br/>
How wondrous to realize,<br/>
The LORD's love for me throughout.<br/>
Through days of joy or of pain,<br/>
The LORD's will is paramount.<br/>
<br/>
