<div class="poetry">
Dancing the dance of ages,<br/>
Entangled feet fail again.<br/>
Rehearsed steps of past wages,<br/>
Prove fruitless amidst the pain.<br/>
<br/>
Lessons from lost love of old,<br/>
Do ill for present comfort—<br/>
Just my own shoulder to hold<br/>
Through this trek in the desert.<br/>
<br/>
Hills of flowing foliage<br/>
Shackled time's disruptive hand<br/>
Yet now I live in bondage:<br/>
A cell with miles of sand.<br/>
<br/>
