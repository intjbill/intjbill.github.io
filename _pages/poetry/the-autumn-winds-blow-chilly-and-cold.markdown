<div class="poetry">
Watchful, caring eyes<br/>
Loving in disguise<br/>
A smiling face.<br/>
A tender embrace.<br/>
Confusing a touch.<br/>
Asking for too much.<br/>
A torn heart in pain.<br/>
Life's lonely again.<br/>
<br/>
One by one images come to me<br/>
In clear, unabated clarity:<br/>
Images of fun and gaiety<br/>
With those of pain and depravity.<br/>
Scenes of such blissful adoration<br/>
Once produced excited sensation.<br/>
Times filled with such painful frustration<br/>
Rendered feelings of decimation.<br/>
<br/>
