<div class="poetry">
How does one pull so much wool,<br/>
In concealing her essence?<br/>
How can all be like a fool,<br/>
Trusting this false appearance?<br/>
<br/>
Oh heart of careless action,<br/>
Why is such numbness displayed?<br/>
Do you not bleed emotion,<br/>
Or know of the pains you've made?<br/>
<br/>
Oh heart of careless action,<br/>
What of those lessons of old?<br/>
Is your gained wisdom now shunned<br/>
Now that you own a new mold?<br/>
<br/>
On this path of illusion,<br/>
You fool yourself with these lies.<br/>
Oh heart of careless action,<br/>
Why plant these seeds of demise?<br/>
<br/>
