<div class="poetry">
That ol' wind that whirls around<br/>
Has seen kingdoms come and go,<br/>
Witnessed joy and wealth abound,<br/>
Blew through pain and poor man's row.<br/>
<br/>
Through happiness and hope's end,<br/>
A constant that has been felt:<br/>
'Tis the soft breeze of the wind<br/>
Which one's life has long been dealt.<br/>
<br/>
Unrestrained by boundaries<br/>
Flows freedom's gentle caress—<br/>
Liberty from miseries,<br/>
Flight from hardship and duress.<br/>
<br/>
Branches sway from side to side;<br/>
Leaves rustle from the soft might.<br/>
I stand with arms outstretched wide;<br/>
My soul absorbs its insight.<br/>
<br/>
Past centuries flow through me;<br/>
All exists in the moment.<br/>
The day is past history;<br/>
The past becomes the present.<br/>
<br/>
It shines for a brief glimmer,<br/>
Yet now its time has fleeted.<br/>
Life itself is similar:<br/>
One's path is soon departed.<br/>
<br/>
