<div class="poetry">
Dusk's breeze accompanies me<br/>
As I glide along the road.<br/>
Common is such luxury,<br/>
Peaceful for the soul's abode.<br/>
<br/>
Galloping with free spirit<br/>
Amidst the lone night's cover,<br/>
There's but one that joins my wit—<br/>
My steel stallion of thunder.<br/>
<br/>
The old road faintly beckons<br/>
Calling me to draw nearer.<br/>
Thoughts of life blow its vague winds<br/>
Demanding for an answer.<br/>
<br/>
Yet, time after time again,<br/>
These travels reveal nothing—<br/>
It's the void that flees within<br/>
My craft's illuminating.<br/>
<br/>
My ship cuts through the night's air<br/>
As I'm lost and lone in thought...<br/>
&quot;It's not the morrow to bear,<br/>
Alas, it's today that's sought!&quot;<br/>
