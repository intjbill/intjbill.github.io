<div class="poetry">
In this incessant struggle<br/>
Between sides of wrong and right,<br/>
Never has there been a lull,<br/>
To cease this long, age-old fight.<br/>
<br/>
One advances—one retreats.<br/>
With a great surge, sides reverse.<br/>
This cycle runs and repeats.<br/>
The plight of an endless curse.<br/>
<br/>
Contrasts locked in these attacks,<br/>
Composed not of flesh and bone,<br/>
With war tactics and strong backs,<br/>
But a heart and soul alone.<br/>
<br/>
So what plagues my cognizance?<br/>
The Fight: Good versus Evil.<br/>
God's way with deliverance<br/>
Or Sins with worldly appeal.<br/>
<br/>
When my foe appears vanquished<br/>
Soon I find I'm overrun.<br/>
My strength fades, I'm soon finished.<br/>
With a heave, I'm far from done.<br/>
<br/>
Tempted by sins of the flesh;<br/>
Beckons from the road of ease;<br/>
I'm entangled by this mesh—<br/>
My lone recourse on my knees.<br/>
<br/>
Personal strength proves fruitless<br/>
For we're not self-reliant.<br/>
There's one way for happiness:<br/>
Through God's plan of sacrament.
