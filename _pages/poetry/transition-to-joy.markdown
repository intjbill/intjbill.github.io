<em>Flowing fields of greenery<br/>
Passes from view in a blur.</em><br/>
<br/>
Choosing to serve my own will,<br/>
Harvested fruits of failure.<br/>
Evil's cloaked advice of ill,<br/>
Shackled with carnal allure.<br/>
<br/>
<em>Foreign headlights of no name,<br/>
Slice through the late evening's air.</em><br/>
<br/>
From the depths of black darkness,<br/>
To heights of such ascension,<br/>
How stunning is this progress,<br/>
What a joyous transition!<br/>
<br/>
<em>The soft drizzle of the rain,<br/>
Mists across the open field.</em><br/>
<br/>
With a joyful gait,<br/>
I walk with the LORD.<br/>
<br/>
