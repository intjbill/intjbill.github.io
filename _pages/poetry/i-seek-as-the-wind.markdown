<div class="poetry">
The twilight's breeze swoons a scene<br/>
Of autumn's ambered dancing.<br/>
<br/>
Roused from their silent slumber,<br/>
The leaves rustle with vigor.<br/>
<br/>
<em>&quot;That ol' wind has come again<br/>
For me to be where I've been<br/>
Spite the space 'tween now and then.&quot;</em><br/><br/>
<br/>
Rummaging for past fervor,<br/>
I flow from that October.<br/>
<br/>
The open road lies in wait;<br/>
The future is the past's gate.<br/>
