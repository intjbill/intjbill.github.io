<div class="poetry">
Time alone within a crowd<br/>
Such has been his own island.<br/>
He shares no ideas aloud,<br/>
His thoughts are his own to tend.<br/>
<br/>
A coffeehouse is the place<br/>
That births his idle writing.<br/>
It proves a fertile base<br/>
For introspective thinking.<br/>
<br/>
Once there came a unique night,<br/>
As he's lost in lethargy.<br/>
A new face catches his sight,<br/>
A semblance of irony.<br/>
<br/>
His focus is thwarted<br/>
By her familiar presence.<br/>
To the past he's directed<br/>
Because of the resemblance.<br/>
<br/>
Soon was he to discover<br/>
The special touch of her warmth.<br/>
She forged her own character<br/>
With the smile that came forth.<br/>
<br/>
Locked in their conversation,<br/>
They closed the establishment.<br/>
The night forced its conclusion<br/>
Ending their shared enjoyment.<br/>
<br/>
In another reunion,<br/>
Gaiety arose for them.<br/>
A refreshing connection,<br/>
Exists between her and him.<br/>
<br/>
Although their days are numbered<br/>
Carpe diem is their cry!<br/>
&quot;Seize the day&quot;—the rest deferred<br/>
<br/>
...I sit back and smile.
