<div class="poetry">
Tears of forlorn bitterness<br/>
Prove as a poor companion.<br/>
Such failure of fruition!<br/>
Who's faithful to the faithless?<br/>
<br/>
Two in tandem broke a heart;<br/>
Rejection shattered the bold.<br/>
What shields one from the bleak hold<br/>
Of the quick, fiery dart?<br/>
