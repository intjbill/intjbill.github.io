<div class="poetry">
Alone within a shroud of rain,<br/>
One seeks solace within thoughts.<br/>
Tumults of the past fall earthward,<br/>
Thus sealing one from intrusion.<br/>
<br/>
Deft movements of the intellect,<br/>
Provided no recourse in love.<br/>
Gained lessons of past miseries,<br/>
Gave no insight for prevention.<br/>
<br/>
Yet, the rain fell true to its form:<br/>
The system, known by its process,<br/>
Holds inherent expectation.<br/>
