<em>The beginning of something new;<br/>
The closure of something worn.</em><br/>
<br/>
Nights of surreal hue;<br/>
Days with shades of blue;<br/>
Streets reflecting the city lights;<br/>
Rain coming down, coming down on me.<br/>
<br/>
Flowing through rays of rain,<br/>
I meander through pleasure and pain.<br/>
Upon my imagination,<br/>
The world spends in rotation.<br/>
<br/>
Scenes of crisp tastes of past days<br/>
All pass in a rainbow daze.<br/>
Metamorphosis of far proximity<br/>
Are portraits of ambiguity.<br/>
<br/>
Provoked by the demons within me,<br/>
There erupts the heart's fury.<br/>
Despite the most noble of efforts,<br/>
My shot falls from its mark.<br/>
<br/>
