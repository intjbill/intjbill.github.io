<div class="poetry">
The mellow, despondent tunes<br/>
Of the singer-songwriter<br/>
Births the ache of bygone moons<br/>
For a poet-warrior.<br/>
<br/>
Sewing with the common thread<br/>
Of the heart's lone betrayal,<br/>
He weaves a cloak of tears shed<br/>
Which warms none and fits a fool.<br/>
<br/>
For how long must we engage<br/>
In this disillusionment?<br/>
Are we not wiser with age<br/>
To solve this predicament?<br/>
<br/>
For its prudent that I must<br/>
Unshackle my heart in this.<br/>
For what do you know of trust<br/>
You, who plays hearts with her kiss?<br/>
<br/>
So I gather my strength<br/>
And toss the coat aside.<br/>
I've worn it for much too long<br/>
And it's time to leave the night.<br/>
