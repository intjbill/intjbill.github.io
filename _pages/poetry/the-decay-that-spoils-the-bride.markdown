WHY DO I FIGHT TO EMBRACE<br/>
THE LIFE OF AN IMMORTAL<br/>
ADOPTING THE WORLDLY PACE<br/>
I'M BLIND TO THE ETERNAL<br/>
<br/>
WHAT KIND OF LIFE CAN IT BE<br/>
TO BE PART OF DEATH'S MIST<br/>
WHAT KIND OF LIFE COULD IT BE<br/>
TO BE APART FROM THAT LIST<br/>
<br/>
WE SACRIFICE OUR OWN YOUNG<br/>
WE HATE THE POOR AND THE OLD<br/>
WE FIND OUR LOVES IN OUR DUNG<br/>
WE FEAST UPON FRUITS OF MOLD<br/>
<br/>
MY SOUL'S FIRE CONSUMES ME<br/>
TO HURL THIS TO THE ABYSS<br/>
ULTIMATE REALITY<br/>
SAVE US WITH YOUR OWN SON'S KISS<br/>
<br/>
