<div class="poetry">
Walking through streams of velvet,<br/>
I'm an ambiance of gray.<br/>
Wrapped in rays of violet,<br/>
The dog gnaws on yesterday.<br/>
<br/>
Discontent and lackluster<br/>
Befriends the lady in red.<br/>
But red is just a color<br/>
As good as black for the dead.<br/>
<br/>
In alleys of scattered lies<br/>
Who needs purpose or design?<br/>
Wooed by the flickering flies,<br/>
The dog sees the neon sign.<br/>
<br/>
Subconscious underpinnings<br/>
Cast down limelight on the frail.<br/>
&quot;Taste the death of my choosing!&quot;<br/>
Cry the mice with worms to sell.<br/>
<br/>
Broken in its nightly flight,<br/>
The clock consoles me to see.<br/>
For 3am holds the light<br/>
Though the view is not the key.<br/>
<br/>
