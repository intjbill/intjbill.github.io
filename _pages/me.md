## Brief Bio
I was born in Memphis and grew up in Tennessee, moving to Arizona in my mid-20s followed by a return to Memphis. In my mid-30s, I lived in Alaska until coming home to West Tennessee. I have had strengths in various disciplines, whether in IT support & documentation or in teaching English on a college level—BUT before the needle turns to pretentious: I’ve sacked groceries; sold trinkets at a mall science store; wrestled a printing press; evaluated dirt and concrete; and made espresso.

## DNA Lineage

Of my 4 sets of great-grandparents, one emigrated from Poland to the United States and another set came over from Lithuania.  The 3rd set of great-grandparents descend from American colonists of Virginia and the Carolinas who went west to eventually settle around the Mississippi River.  As for the fourth, my direct paternal line, I know nothing beyond the 19th century as to how they reached the South.
