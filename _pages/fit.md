## Dreams

Featherweight footfalls wind deeply down the canyon of a forested path, beyond the day's embers into the twilight. Lightweight legs flow into the streams of a city nightscape, past the shadows of the nocturnal.

I feel free in these encounters.

For the past several years, I have a reoccurring dream where I am running. I am neither running away from nor running specifically to anything. I run with an enhanced agility.

But with the sunrise, this bliss of identity fades back, as Reality storms obnoxiously and ever so extrovertly into my bedroom as a veritable huckster; this Kool-Aid Man proffering the most foul juice of Hell and then choking it down my throat in my waking moments.

I return with all of the unmeasured and jarring gait of a concrete truck. My feet are stymied by an overload from past missteps.

I desire to shred fat with a focus on endurance all within the context to balance stamina, strength, and agility…

* To move freely and interact in the world;
* To glide upon the earth and spring to the heavens above;
* To stretch out my arms like Wolverine and rail against the tempest of Death.

## Diet

### The Realization After 808 Days of a Calorie-Restricted Diet

I have come to a conclusion that calories do not bear weight as to success in weightloss, that's it's a game that's all about manipulating my organ of adipose tissue. Step back and look at the big picture: yes, calorie reduction has a temporary effect, but the body responds to the scarcity by lowering metabolism. And for whatever reason, our body puts our fat at the front of the line to be served incoming calories first, even at the detriment to the rest of the body. Wild stuff, I know!


It's not that I didn't give a low calorie approach a good try! At 1150 kcal while hitting RDAs and amino acids while working out 2-4 hours a day for six days a week when I was on, calorie restriction was my overall intent from April 2018 into June 2020. But, could it resist the rollercoaster ride back up the scale? The 1st 808 Days: April 2, 2018 - June 17, 2020. **Net loss: 29 lbs.**

### Keto to Carnivore: the Winning Approach

I'm a carnivore—should we expect anything less from an Ellendale Bear, a Bolton Wildcat, a Memphis Tiger, and one night as a Seawolf? OK, so I was an Oak Ram along with a Nebraska Cornhusker—but let me support my sampling bias!

What does this mean? My day-to-day is typically beef, water, eggs, and coffee with some butter. No seasonings beyond salt 99% of the time. I've written SEVERAL posts about this approach [A Sunset, the Speedboat, a Cascade of Ocean Mist, and The Dolphin's Cry: I Wanna Change My Clothes, My Hair, My Face!](/2020-11-30-the-dolphins-cry/). I became a carnivore after watching [The 10+ year Carnivores take on: Fasting, Salt, Organs, Electrolytes, Cheating, &amp; their Lab-Work](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YO4UR3LQZMU) . For more, take the red pill and see where it leads starting from [Kelly Hogan's myzerocarblife YouTube channel](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCaKl8Lth6h6GWreFyeO1keA).
